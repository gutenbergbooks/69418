<p class="pfirst">HE Art of Ukiyo-ye is a “spiritual rendering of the
realism and naturalness of the daily life, intercourse with
nature, and imaginings, of a lively impressionable race, in
the full tide of a passionate craving for art.” This characterization
of Jarves sums up forcibly the motive of the masters of
Ukiyo-ye, the Popular School of Japanese Art, so poetically interpreted
“The Floating World.”</p>

<p>To the Passionate Pilgrim, and devotee of nature and art, who
has visited the enchanted Orient, it is unnecessary to prepare the way
for the proper understanding of Ukiyo-ye. This joyous idealist
trusts less to dogma than to impressions. “I know nothing of Art,
but I know what I like,” is the language of sincerity, sincerity which
does not take a stand upon creed or tradition, nor upon cut and dried
principles and conventions. It is truly said that “they alone can pretend
to fathom the depth of feeling and beauty in an alien art, who
resolutely determine to scrutinize it from the point of view of an inhabitant
of the place of its birth.”</p>

<p>To the born cosmopolite, who assimilates alien ideas by instinct,
or the gauging power of his sub-conscious intelligence, the feat is easy,
but to the less intuitively gifted, it is necessary to serve a novitiate, in
order to appreciate “a wholly recalcitrant element like Japanese Art,
which at once demands attention, and defies judgment upon accepted
theories.” These sketches are not an individual expression, but an
endeavour to give in condensed form the opinions of those qualified by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
study and research to speak with authority upon the form
of Japanese Art, which in its most concrete development
the Ukiyo-ye print is now claiming the attention of the
art world.</p>

<p>The development of colour printing is, however, only the objective
symbol of Ukiyo-ye, for, as our Western oracle, Professor Fenollosa,
said, “The true history of Ukiyo-ye, although including prints
as one of its most fascinating diversions, is not a history of the technical
art of printing, rather an æsthetic history of a peculiar kind
of design.”</p>

<p>The temptation to make use of one more quotation, in concluding
these introductory remarks, is irresistible, for in it Walter Pater sets
his seal upon art as a legitimate pursuit, no matter what form it takes,
though irreconcilable with preconceived ideas and traditions. “The
legitimate contention is not of one age or school of art against another,
but of all successive schools alike, against the stupidity which is dead
to the substance, and the vulgarity which is dead to form.”</p>

<p>As the Popular School (Ukiyo-ye) was the outcome of over a
thousand years of growth, it is necessary to glance back along the
centuries in order to understand and follow the processes of its development.</p>

<p>Though the origin of painting in Japan is shrouded in obscurity,
and veiled in tradition, there is no doubt that China and Corea were
the direct sources from which she derived her art; whilst more indirectly
she was influenced by Persia and India,—the sacred fount
of oriental art,—as of religion, which ever went hand in hand.</p>

<p>In China, the Ming dynasty gave birth to an original style, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
for centuries dominated the art of Japan; the sweeping
calligraphic strokes of Hokusai mark the sway of
hereditary influence, and his wood-cutters, trained to
follow the graceful, fluent lines of his purely Japanese
work, were staggered by his sudden flights into angular realism.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Buddhist schools of art dated from the
sixth century, and in Japan the Emperor Heizei founded an imperial
academy in 808. This academy, and the school of Yamato,
founded by Motomitsu in the eleventh century, led up to the celebrated
school of Tosa, which with Kano, its august and aristocratic rival,
held undisputed supremacy for centuries, until challenged by plebeian
Ukiyo-ye, the school of the common people of Japan.</p>

<p>Tosa has been characterized as the “manifestation of ardent
faith, through the purity of an ethereal style.” Tosa represented the
taste of the court of Kyoto, and was relegated to the service of the
aristocracy; it reflected the esoteric mystery of Shinto and the hallowed
entourage of the divinely descended Mikado. The ceremonial
of the court, its fêtes and religious solemnities,—dances attended by
daimios, in robes of state falling in full harmonious folds,—were
depicted with consummate elegance and delicacy of touch, which
betrayed familiarity with the occult methods of Persian miniature
painting. The Tosa artists used very fine, pointed brushes, and set
off the brilliance of their colouring with resplendent backgrounds in
gold leaf, and it is to Tosa we owe the intricate designs, almost
microscopic in detail, which are to be seen upon the most beautiful
specimens of gold lacquer work; and screens, which for richness have
never been surpassed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>Japanese Art was ever dominated by the priestly
hierarchy, and also by temporal rulers, and of this
the school of Tosa was a noted example, as it received
its title from the painter-prince, Tsunetaka, who, besides
being the originator of an artistic centre, held the position of vice-governor
of the province of Tosa. From its incipience, Tosa owed its
prestige to the Mikado and his nobles, as later Kano became the
official school of the usurping Shoguns. Thus the religious, political
and artistic history of Japan were ever closely allied. The Tosa
style was combated by the influx of Chinese influence, culminating in
the fourteenth century, in the rival school of Kano. The school of
Kano owed its origin to China. At the close of the fourteenth century
the Chinese Buddhist priest, Josetsu, left his own country for
Japan, and bringing with him Chinese tradition, he founded a new
dynasty whose descendants still represent the most illustrious school of
painting in Japan. The Kano school to this day continues to be
the stronghold of classicism, which in Japan signifies principally
adherence to Chinese models, a traditional technique, and avoidance
of subjects which represent every-day life. The Chinese calligraphic
stroke lay at the root of the technique of Kano, and the Japanese brush
owed its facility elementarily to the art of writing. Dexterous
handling of the brush is necessary to produce these bold, incisive
strokes, and the signs of the alphabet require little expansion to resolve
themselves into draped forms, and as easily they can be decomposed
into their abstract element.</p>

<p>Walter Crane inculcates the wisdom of this method for preliminary
practice with the brush in his valuable study, “Line and Form,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
but the Chinese and Japanese ideographs give a far
wider scope to initial brush work.</p>

<p>The early artists of Kano reduced painting to an
academic art, and destroyed naturalism, until the genius
of Masanobu, who gave his name to the school, and still more, that
of his son, Motonobu, the real “Kano,” grafted on to Chinese models,
and monotony of monochrome, a warmth of colour and harmony of
design which regenerated and revivified the whole system. Kano
yielded to Chinese influence, Tosa combated it, and strove for a
purely national art, Ukiyo-ye bridged the chasm, and became the
exponent of both schools, bringing about an expansion in art which
could never have been realized by these aristocratic rivals. The
vigour and force of the conquering Shoguns led Kano, while the lustre
of Tosa was an emanation from the sanctified and veiled Mikado.</p>

<p>The favourite subjects of the Kano painters were chiefly Chinese
saints and philosophers, mythological and legendary heroes, represented
in various attitudes with backgrounds of conventional clouds
and mists, interspersed with symbolical emblems. Many of the Kano
saints and heroes bear a striking resemblance to mediæval subjects, as
they are often represented rising from billowy cloud masses, robed in
ethereal draperies, and with heads encircled by the nimbus.</p>

<p>Beneath the brush of Motonobu, formal classicism melted. In
this new movement, says Kakuzo Okakura, “art fled from man to
nature, and in the purity of ink landscapes, in the graceful spray of
bamboos and pines, sought and found her asylum.”</p>

<p>Space will not permit a glance at the personnel of the many
schools of Japanese Art. A lengthy catalogue alone would be required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
to enumerate the masters who inaugurated schools,
for if an artist developed exceptional talent in Japan,
he immediately founded an individual school, and it
was incumbent upon his descendants for generations to
adhere rigidly to the principles he had inculcated, so becoming slaves
to traditional methods.</p>

<p>During the anarchy of the fourteenth century art stagnated in
Japan, but a revival, corresponding with our European Renaissance,
followed. The fifteenth century in Japan, as in Europe, was essentially
the age of revival. Wm. Anderson epitomizes in one pregnant
phrase this working power: “All ages of healthy human prosperity
are more or less revivals. A little study would probably show that
the Ptolemaic era in Egypt was a renaissance of the Theban age,
in architecture as in other respects, while the golden period of
Augustus in Rome was largely a Greek revival.” There seems ever
to have been a reciprocal action in Japanese Art. Tosa, famed for
delicacy of touch, minutiæ of detail and brilliance of colour, yielded
to the black and white, vigorous force of Kano. Kano again was
modified by the glowing colouring introduced by Kano Masanobu
and Motonobu. Later we see the varied palette of Miyagawa
Choshun efface the monochromic simplicity of Moronobu, the ringleader
of the printers of Ukiyo-ye.</p>

<p>The leading light in art in the beginning of the fifteenth century
was Cho Densu, the Fra Angelico of Japan, who, a simple monk,
serving in a Kyoto temple, must in a trance of religious and artistic
ecstasy have beheld a spectrum of fadeless dyes, so wondrous were
the colours he lavished upon the draperies of his saints and sages.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
The splendour of this beatific vision has never faded,
for the masters who followed in the footsteps of the
inspired monk reverently preserved the secret of these
precious shades, till at last, in the form of the Ukiyo-ye
print, they were sown broadcast, and revolutionized the colour sense
of the art world.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that Japanese Art of the nineteenth century
is often nothing but a reproduction of the works of the ancient great
masters, and the methods and mannerisms of the fifteenth century
artists have ever served as examples for later students. The glory of
the fifteenth century was increased by Mitsunobu of Tosa, and above
all by the two great Kano artists, Masanobu and his son, Motonobu,
who received the title of “Hogen,” and is referred to as “Ko Hogen,”
or the ancient Hogen, of whom it has been remarked, “He filled the
air with luminous beams.”</p>

<p>By the close of the fifteenth century the principles of art in Japan
became definitely fixed, as, almost contemporaneously, Giotto established
a canon of art in Florence, which he, in turn, had received
from the Attic Greeks, through Cimabue, and which was condensed
by Ruskin into a grammar of art, under the term “Laws of Fésole.”</p>

<p>The two great schools, Tosa and Kano, flourished independently
until the middle of the eighteenth century, when the genius of the popular
artists, forming the school of Ukiyo-ye, gradually fused the traditions
of Tosa and Kano, absorbing the methods of these rival
schools,—which, differing in technique and motive, were united in their
proud disdain of the new art which dared to represent the manners
and customs of the common people. Harunobu and Hokusai,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Kiyonaga and Hiroshige were the crowning glory of all
the schools,—the artists whose genius told the story
of their country, day by day, weaving a century of
history into one living encyclopedia, sumptuous in form,
kaleidoscopic in colour.</p>

<p>Ukiyo-ye prepared Japan for intercourse with other nations by
developing in the common people an interest in other countries, in
science and foreign culture, and by promoting the desire to travel,
through the means of illustrated books of varied scenes. To Ukiyo-ye,
the Japanese owed the gradual expansion of international consciousness,
which culminated in the revolution of 1868,—a revolution,
the most astonishing in history, accomplished as if by miracle;
but the esoteric germ of this seemingly spontaneous growth of Meiji
lay in the atelier of the artists of Ukiyo-ye.</p>

<p>To trace the evolution of the Popular School in its development
through nearly three centuries is a lengthy study, of deep interest.
The mists of uncertainty gather about the lives of many apostles of
Ukiyo-ye, from the originator, Iwasa Matahei, to Hiroshige, one of
the latest disciples, whose changes of style and diversity of signature
have given rise to the supposition that as many as three artists are
entitled to the name. These mists of tradition cannot be altogether
dispersed by such indefatigable students as M. Louis Gonse, Professor
Fenollosa, M. Edmond de Goncourt, Wm. Anderson, John
S. Happer and many others, but by their aid the methods of Oriental
Art are clarified and explained.</p>

<p>Iwasa Matahei, the date of whose birth is given as 1578, is considered
to be the originator of the Popular School. The spontaneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
growth of great movements and the mystery of the
source of genius are illustrated in the career of Matahei.
His environment fitted him to follow in the footsteps of
his master, Mitsunori of Tosa. Yet the city of Kyoto,
veiled in mystic sanctity, where religion and princely patronage held
art in conventional shackles, gave birth to the leader of the Popular
School. Still, was not Kyoto, the sacred heart of Japan, a fit cradle
for Ukiyo-ye, the life and soul of the Japanese people?</p>

<p>Matahei and his followers entered into the spirit of the Japanese
temperament, and from the Popular School sprang liberty and a
novelty of horizon. The aristocratic schools had confined themselves
to representations of princely pageantry, to portraiture, and to ideal
pictures of mythical personages, saints and sages. The tradition of
China showed in all their landscapes, which reflected ethereal vistas
classically rendered, of an alien land. Therefore Matahei was contemptuously
disowned by Tosa for depicting scenes from the life of
his countrymen, yet the technique of Kano and Tosa were the birthright
of the artists of Ukiyo-ye, an inalienable inheritance in form,
into which they breathed the spirit of life, thus revivifying an art
grown cold and academical, and frosted with tradition. The colouring
of Kano had faded, tending continually toward monochrome, but
the Ukiyo-ye painters restored the use of gorgeous pigments, preserving
the glory of Kano Yeitoku, the court painter to Hideyoshi.</p>

<p>In the middle of the seventeenth century appeared Hishigawa
Moronobu, considered by many to be the real founder of Ukiyo-ye.
His genius welded with the new motif the use of the block for printing,
an innovation which led to the most characteristic development in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Ukiyo-ye art. This art of printing, which originated
in China and Corea, had, until the beginning of the
seventeenth century, been confined solely to the service
of religion for the reproduction of texts and images, but
Moronobu conceived the idea of using the form of printed book
illustration, just coming into vogue, as a channel to set forth the life
of the people. Besides painting and illustrating books, he began
printing single sheets, occasionally adding to the printed outlines
dashes of colour from the brush, principally in orange and green.
These sheets, the precursors of the Ukiyo-ye prints, superseded the
<i>Otsu-ye</i>,—impressionistic hand-paintings, draughted hastily for rapid
circulation. The <i>Otsu-ye</i> were sometimes richly illuminated, the
largest surfaces in the costumes being filled in with a ground of black
lacquer, and ornamented with layers of gold leaf attached by varnish.</p>

<p>Moronobu acquired his technique from both Tosa and Kano, but
was originally a designer for the rich brocades and tissues woven in
Kyoto. He added to this art that of embroidery, and leaving Kyoto,
took up this branch at the rival city Yedo, where all the arts and
crafts were developing under the fostering care of the Tokugawa
Shoguns, the dynasty with which Ukiyo-ye art is practically co-extensive.
It was Hishigawa Moronobu who designed for his countrywomen
their luxurious trailing robes, with enormous sleeves, richly
embroidered,—gorgeous and stately garments which he loved to
reproduce on paper, with marvellous powers of sweeping line. As
in all fashions of dress, in time the graceful lines became exaggerated
until, in the beginning of the nineteenth century, they overstepped the
limits of beauty, and approached the realm of caricature. Today, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
the modern poster, we see perpetuated the degenerate
offspring of the genius of Moronobu, of whom it is
remarked that his enlarged compositions have the plasticity
of bas-reliefs.</p>

<p>An artist who greatly influenced Moronobu was Tanyu, of the
School of Kano, whose masterpiece may be seen at the great temple
in Kyoto,—four painted panels of lions, of indescribable majesty.
M. Louis Gonse tells us that one of Tanyu’s kakemonos, belonging to
a celebrated French painter, well sustains the test of comparison with
its companion pictures, in the artist’s studio, by Durer, Rembrandt
and Rubens. Under Tanyu’s direction the task of reproducing the
old masterpieces was undertaken. The artists of Ukiyo-ye were ever
ready to profit by the teaching of all the schools; therefore, properly
to follow the methods of the Popular School, we must study the work
of the old masters and the subjects from which they derived their
inspiration.</p>

<p>In this brief resumé we cannot follow the fluctuations of Japanese
Art through the centuries. During long periods of conflict and bloody
internecine strife, art languished; when peace reigned, then in the
seclusion of their <i>yashikis</i> these fierce and princely warriors threw
down their arms and surrendered themselves to the service of beauty
and of art. Nor had the dainty inmates of their castles languished
idly during these stirring times. Often they defended their honour
and their homes against treacherous neighbours. It was a Japanese
woman who led her conquering countrymen into Corea. In the arts
of peace the cultured women of Japan kept pace with their lovers and
husbands. A woman revised and enlarged the alphabet, and some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
of the most beautiful classic poems are ascribed to them.
Well might the Japanese fight fiercely for his altar and
home, with the thought of the flower-soft hands that were
waiting to strip him of his armour and stifle with caresses
the recollection of past conflict. The early history of Japan suggests
a comparison with ancient Greece, and the Japanese poets might have
apostrophized their country, as did Byron the land of his adoption:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"The isles of Greece, the isles of Greece!<br ></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where burning Sappho loved and sung,</span><br ></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where grew the arts of war and peace,—<br ></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where Delos rose, and Phœbus sprung!"</span><br ></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Happily Japan, unlike Greece, withstood the enervating influences
of luxury and the passionate adoration of beauty. Princes laboured
alike with chisel and with brush, and the loftiest rulers disdained not
the tool of the artisan. Art Industrial kissed Grand Art, which
remained virile beneath the sturdy benediction. Therefore Japan lives,
unlike Greece, whose beauty in decay called forth that saddest of
dirges, ending,</p>

<p class="center">
“’Tis Greece, but living Greece no more.”<br >
</p>

<p>In Japan, art lightens the burden of labour, utility and beauty go
hand in hand, and the essential and the real reach upward, and touch
the beautiful and the ideal.</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap"

<p class="pfirst">HE Nen-go of Genroku, from 1688 to 1703, was that
period of incomparable glory which the Japanese revere
as the French do the time of Louis the Fourteenth.
Peace had long reigned and art flourished under the
fostering care of the Tokugawa Shoguns.</p>

<p>Then lived the great worker in lacquer, Korin, pupil of Sotatsu,
the flower painter, unrivalled artists who had absorbed the secrets of
both Kano and Tosa. Itcho, the grand colourist, flourished, and
Kenzan, brother of Korin, the “Exponent in pottery decoration of the
Korin School.”</p>

<p>Yedo, the new capital of the usurping Tokugawas, now became
the Mecca of genius, rivalling the ancient metropolis Kyoto, for the
great Shoguns encouraged art in all forms, not disdaining to enroll
themselves as pupils to the masters in painting and lacquer. The
greatest ruler became one of the greatest artists, even assuming the
art title of Sendai Shogun. In this age the height of perfection was
reached in metal work, both chased and cast.</p>

<p>“The sword is the soul of the Samurai,” says the old Japanese
motto, therefore its decoration and adornment was a sacred service to
which genius delighted to dedicate itself. In Japan the greatest artists
were sometimes carvers and painters and workers in metals in one, and
suggest comparison with the European masters of two centuries earlier.
Did not Botticelli take his name from the goldsmith for whom he
worked, and Leonardo da Vinci began his art life by "twisting metal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
screens for the tombs of the Medici"? Later we see
him playing before his patron, Francesco, in Milan, upon
that weird silver harp he had himself constructed, till at
last, perfected in art, he projected upon canvas the
Mona Lisa, that “realization of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries
and exquisite passions.”</p>

<p>Also in Japan, as in Europe, the genius of the nation was consecrated
to the dead. More than half of Michelangelo’s life was
devoted to the decoration of tombs, and the shrines of the Shoguns
are the greatest art monuments in Japan. Preoccupation with graves
perhaps enabled the Japanese to face death so readily, even embracing
it upon the slightest pretext.</p>

<p>Genroku was the acme of the age of chivalry. Its tales of deadly
duels and fierce vendettas are the delight of the nation. The history
of the Forty-seven Ronin equals any mediæval tale of bloodthirsty
vengeance and feudal devotion. This Japanese vendetta of the seventeenth
century is still re-enacted upon the stage, and remains the
most popular drama of the day, and the actor designers of Torii ever
delighted in it as a subject for illustration. A brief outline of the
story may be of interest and serve to recall its charming interpretation
by Mitford.</p>

<p>The cause of this famous drama of vendetta was the avarice of
Kotsuki-no-Suke, a courtier of the Shogun at Yedo who might have
served as prototype for “Pooh Bah,” in Gilbert’s clever burlesque.
This pompous official was detailed to receive at his castle and instruct
in court etiquette two provincial noblemen, to whom had been assigned
the onerous task of entertaining the Mikado’s envoy from Kyoto. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
return for this tutelage they duly sent many gifts to
Kotsuki-no-Suke, but not costly enough to gratify the
rapacity of the Gilbertian minister, who day by day
became more insufferably arrogant, not having been
“sufficiently insulted.”</p>

<p>Then a counsellor of one of these great lords, being wise in his
generation, and fearing for his master’s safety, rode at midnight to
the castle of the greedy official, leaving a present or bribe of a thousand
pieces of silver. This generous donation had the desired effect.</p>

<p>“You have come early to court, my lord,” was the suave welcome
the unconscious nobleman received the next morning. “I shall have
the honour of calling your attention to several points of etiquette today.”
The next moment the countenance of Kotsuki-no-Suke
clouded, and, turning haughtily toward his other pupil from whom
no largesse had been received, he cried, “Here, my lord of Takumi,
be so good as to tie for me the ribbon of my sock,” adding under
his breath, “boor of the provinces.”</p>

<p>"Stop, my lord!" cried Takumi-no-Kami, and, drawing his dirk,
he flung it at the insolent nobleman’s head. Then a great tumult
arose. His court cap had saved from death Kotsuki-no-Suke, and
he fled from the spot, whilst Takumi-no-Kami was arrested, and to
divert the disgrace of being beheaded, hastily performed hari-kiri;
his goods and castle were confiscated and his retainers became Ronin
(literally “Wave Men”), cast adrift to follow their fortunes, roving
at will.</p>

<p>The vendetta, sworn to and carried out by these forty-seven faithful
servants, is the sequel of the story. Oishi Kuranosuki, the chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
of the Ronin, planned the scheme of revenge. To put
Kotsuki-no-Suke off his guard, the band dispersed, many
of them under the disguise of workmen taking service
in the <i>yashiki</i> of their enemy in order to become familiar
with the interior of the fortification.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Kuranosuki, to further mislead his enemies, plunged
into a life of wild dissipation, until Kotsuki-no-Suke, hearing of his
excesses, relaxed his own vigilance, only keeping half the guard he
had at first appointed. The wife and friends of Kuranosuki were
greatly grieved at his loose conduct, for he took nobody into his confidence.
Even a man from Satsuma, seeing him lying drunk in the
open street, dared to kick his body, muttering, “Faithless beast, thou
givest thyself up to women and wine, thou art unworthy of the name
of a Samurai.”</p>

<p>But Kuranosuki endured the contumely, biding his time, and at
last, in the winter of the following year, when the ground was white
with snow, the carefully planned assault was successfully attempted.
The castle of Kotsuki-no-Suke was taken, but what was the consternation
of the brave Ronin, when, after a prolonged search, they failed
to discover their victim! In despair, they were about to despatch
themselves, in accordance with their severe code of honour, when
Kuranosuki, pushing aside a hanging picture, discovered a secret
courtyard. There, hidden behind some sacks of charcoal, they found
their enemy, and dragged him out, trembling with cold and terror,
clad in his costly nightrobe of embroidered white satin. Then humbly
kneeling, Oishi Kuranosuki thus addressed him: “My lord, we beseech
you to perform Seppuku (happy despatch). I shall have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
honour to act as your lordship’s second, and when, with
all humility, I shall have received your lordship’s head,
it is my intention to lay it as an offering upon the grave
of our master, Asano-Takumi-no-Kami.” Unfortunately,
the carefully planned programme of the Ronin failed to recommend
itself to Kotsuki-no-Suke, and he declined their polite invitation
to disembowel himself, whereupon Kuranosuki at one stroke cut off
the craven head, with the blade used by his master in taking his own
life.</p>

<p>So in solemn procession the Forty-seven Ronin, bearing their
enemy’s head, approached the Temple of Sengakuji, where they were
met by the abbot of the monastery, who led them to their master’s
tomb. There, after washing in water, they laid it, thus accomplishing
the vendetta; then praying for decent burial and for masses, they
took their own lives.</p>

<p>Thus ended the tragic story, and visitors to the temple are still
shown the receipt given by the retainers of the son of Kotsuki-no-Suke
for the head of their lord’s father, returned to them by the priest of
Sengakuji. Surely it is one of the weirdest relics to take in one’s hand,
this memorandum, the simple wording of which but adds to its horror:</p>

<p>Item—One head.</p>

<p>Item—One paper parcel, and then the signatures of the two retainers
beneath.</p>

<p>Another manuscript is also shown, in which the Ronin addressed
their departed lord, laying it upon his tomb. It is translated thus by
Mitford:</p>

<p>“The fifteenth year of Genroku, the twelfth month, and fifteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
day. We have come this day to do homage here, forty-seven
men in all, from Oishi Kuranosuki, down to the
foot soldier, Terasaka Kichiyemon, all cheerfully about
to lay down our lives on your behalf. We reverently
announce this to the honoured spirit of our dead master. On the
fourteenth day of the third month of last year our honoured master
was pleased to attack Kira-Kotsuki-no-Suke, for what reason we
know not. Our honoured master put an end to his own life, but
Kotsuki-no-Suke lived. Although we fear that after the decree issued
by the Government, this plot of ours will be displeasing to our
master, still we who have eaten of your food could not without blushing
repeat the verse, ‘Thou shalt not live under the same heaven nor
tread the same earth with the enemy of thy father or lord,’ nor could
we have dared to leave hell and present ourselves before you in
paradise, unless we had carried out the vengeance which you began.
Every day that we waited seemed as three autumns to us. Verily
we have trodden the snow for one day, nay for two days, and have
tasted food but once. The old and decrepit, the sick and ailing,
have come forth gladly to lay down their lives. Having taken
counsel together last night, we have escorted my lord, Kotsuki-no-Suke,
hither to your tomb. This dirk by which our honoured lord
set great store last year, and entrusted to our care, we now bring
back. If your noble spirit be now present before this tomb, we pray
you as a sign to take the dirk, and striking the head of your enemy
with it a second time to dispel your hatred forever. This is the
respectful statement of forty-seven men.”</p>

<p>There were forty-seven Ronin. Why, then, do forty-eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
tomb-stones stand beneath the cedars at Sengakuji?
Truly the answer has caused tears to fall from the
eyes of many a visiting pilgrim, for the forty-eighth
tomb holds the body of the Satsuma man, who in
an agony of grief and remorse ended his life, and was buried beside
the hero, whose body he had scornfully trampled upon in the streets
of sacred Kyoto.</p>

<p>This history of the Forty-seven Ronin is an epitome of Japanese
ethics, for in it is exemplified their feudal devotion, their severe code
of honour, their distorted vision of duty and fealty to a superior,
justifying the most lawless acts. Thus the conduct of Kuranosuki
during his wild year of reckless abandonment, in which he threw off
all moral restraint in order to deceive his enemy, breaking the heart
of his faithful and devoted wife, was considered by his countrymen
meritorious and a proof of his devotion. The Ukiyo-ye artists,
who loved to take for models the beautiful denizens of the “Under
World,” chose this obsession of Kuranosuki as the subject for many
of their illustrations, so that at a first glance the series might almost
be mistaken for scenes from the life of the Yoshiwara.</p>

<p>Here and there, however, we come across the Ronin engaged
in terrific conflict with Kotsuki-no-Suke’s retainers. Cruel and bloodthirsty
are the blades of their relentless katanas, which once unsheathed
must be slaked in human blood, and their garments, slashed
into stiletto-like points of inky blackness, forming a <i>chevaux de frise</i>
round their fierce faces, seem scintillant with the spirit of vendetta.</p>

<p>In examining the sets of impressions, illustrating the popular
story, it is hard to give preference to any special artist: to choose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
between the Utamaro-like violets and greens of
Yeisen; the rich dark tints and fine backgrounds of
Kunisada; the delicately massed detail of Toyokuni,
unlike the usual boldness of his style, and the varied
sword-play of the versatile Hiroshige, set in a frosted, snowy
landscape. Hokusai, who abjured theatrical subjects after breaking
away from the tutelage of Shunsho, published a series of prints
illustrating the famous vendetta, but as his great-grandfather had
been a retainer of Kotsuki-no-Suke, losing his life during the
midnight attack, the story formed part of his ancestral history.
The series is signed Kako, and the sweeping lines and contours
of the female figures show the Kiyonaga influence. Yellow preponderates,
outlining the buildings and long interior vistas, and the
impressions are framed with a singular convention of Hokusai at
that period, drifting cloud effects in delicate pink. Utamaro also
illustrated the story, substituting for the Ronin the forms of women,
a favourite conceit of the artist of beauty.</p>

<p>This digression in favour of the masters of the Popular School
has carried us over a hundred years, and we must return to the close
of the seventeenth century. Moronobu illustrated the carnival of
Genroku, but toward the end of the century, under the domination
of a Shogun who combined the qualities of extravagance and profligacy
with the delirious superstition of a Louis the Eleventh, a
period of unbridled license set in. The military men, who were
the nation’s models, forgot their fine traditions and fell from their
estate, so that the latter manners and customs of Genroku became a
by-word. Then followed a puritanical reaction. Under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
eighth Shogun, the knights were restricted from attending
the theatre, just coming into favour, and the looser
haunts of pleasure were strictly under ban. The
Ukiyo-ye print, being the medium for illustrating these
joys and pleasures, forbidden to the great, but still indulged in by
the people, was strictly condemned, and to this day the aristocracy
of Japan accord but grudging and unwilling recognition to the merits
of the masters of Ukiyo-ye, the old caste prejudice still blinding their
artistic sense.</p>

<p>At this stage Ukiyo-ye broke into rival schools, the founders of
both belonging to the academy of Hishigawa Moronobu. The leader
of the first, the school of painting, was Miyagawa Choshun, who in
order to preserve aristocratic patronage and praise, eschewed the use
of the printing-block, still taking his subjects from the “floating world,”
and so being in one sense at unity with the other branch, that of printing
founded by Kiyonobu, the first master of the great Torii School.
As the Print artists are our subject matter we cannot follow the other
branch of Ukiyo-ye, founded by Miyagawa Choshun, but leaving the
atelier of the painters, we must devote ourselves to the fortunes of the
Torii School, the laboratory of the Ukiyo-ye print, working parallel
with the pictorial school for the first half of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The first sheets of Kiyonobu (about 1710), the founder of the
Torii School, were printed in ink from a single block. Part of the
edition would be issued in this uncoloured form, the rest being
coloured by hand. The colours most used were olive and orange,
these prints being called <i>Tan-ye</i>, whilst those in ink were named
<i>Sumi-ye</i>. Urishi-ye (lacquer pictures), was the generic term for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
hand-painted prints. <i>Beni-ye</i> (literally red pictures),
followed the Urishi-ye. They were printed in two tones,
rose and pale green, enforced by black, a harmony
exquisite in delicacy. The use of the multiple colour
blocks gave rise to the title <i>Nishiki-ye</i>, or brocade paintings. The
national mania for the stage induced Kiyonobu and his followers to
take for their subjects popular actors, and the theatrical poster may
be said to date from the decade following Genroku.</p>

<p>Later in the century the process of colour-printing by the substitution
of blocks for flat colours was gradually evolved, and to no
special artist or engraver can the credit be given, for all contributed
to its development, though the genius of Suzuki Harunobu drew
to a focus in 1765 the achievements of his brother artists, and it
was he who solved the problem of uniting the skill of the engraver
with the full palette of Miyagawa Choshun and his follower Shunsui,
thus uniting the two branches of Ukiyo-ye art.</p>

<p>The Popular School, however, is bound up with print development.
Japanese book illustration and single-sheet printing revolutionized
the world’s art. The great connoisseurs of colour tell
us that nowhere else is anything like it, so rich and so full, that a print
comes to have every quality of a complete painting.</p>

<p>The other leaders of the Torii School were Torii Kiyomasu
and Okumura Masanobu, namesake of the great founder of Kano,
who must not be confounded with the later artist of the same name,
belonging to the school of Kitao. Masanobu deserves special mention,
for his style being chiefly pictorial, and his subjects not confined to
the stage, he formed a link between the painter’s atelier and his own.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_037" style="max-width: 81.25em;">

  <div class="caption"> An illustration from
“The Occupations of
Women.” By Suzuki Harunobu,
who, though a
worker in prints, styled
himself
“Yamato Yeshi,”
the title assigned to the
great court painters.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>He realized that book prints rather than actor prints
ought to be the most potent force of Ukiyo-ye.</p>

<p>Shigenaga followed in the footsteps of Masanobu,
but his fame is eclipsed by that of his great pupil
Harunobu, whose genius was displayed not only by the introduction
of new colours upon the printing-block, but by his schemes of arrangement,
juxtaposition of shades, and marvellous handling of the
areas between the printed outlines. This restriction of measured
spaces does not cramp the painter’s individuality and sweep of brush;
rather, they set him free to concentrate his genius upon blended harmonies,
and interwoven schemes of colour, and to surrender himself
to the intoxication of the palette.</p>

<p>Suzuki Harunobu revolutionized the status of the Popular
School, pronouncing this dictum, “Though I am a worker in prints
I shall hereafter style myself ‘Yamato Yeishi,’” the title assumed by
the ancient court painters. A national painter he declared himself,
let him deny who dare, working through the new medium of the
despised and ostracized Ukiyo-ye print from which he determined
to remove the stigma of vulgarity.</p>

<p>Now we see a strange transposition in the aims of the popular
artists. Harunobu, though a pupil of Shigenaga, the printer, took
for his models the subjects of the painter Shunsui, successor to
Miyagawa Choshun, and by rejecting stage motives discarded the
Torii tradition. From Shunsui, Harunobu borrowed the ineffable
grace and refinement which breathe from the forms of his women,
from the painter he stole colour harmonies and designs with landscape
backgrounds, which the Torii School had hitherto ignored.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
The introduction of genre painting, though attributed
by Walter Pater to Giorgione, applies equally to the
work of Harunobu and his follower Koriusai. “He
is the inventor of genre, of those easily movable pictures
which serve neither for uses of devotion nor of allegorical or historical
teaching: little groups of real men and women, amid congruous
furniture or landscape, morsels of actual life, conversation or music
or play, refined upon and idealized till they come to seem like glimpses
of life from afar. People may move those spaces of cunningly blent
colour readily and take them with them where they go, like a poem
in manuscript, or a musical instrument, to be used at will as a means
of self-education, stimulus or solace, coming like an animated presence
into one’s cabinet, and like persons live with us for a day or a
lifetime.” Must not such an influence have descended upon
Whistler when, saturated with the atmosphere of Hiroshige, he
imagined that most beautiful of his “Nocturnes” described by
Theodore Child as "a vision in form and colour, in luminous air, a
Japanese fancy realized on the banks of the gray Thames"?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_School_of_Torii">The School of Torii.<br >

<small>The Printers’ Branch of Ukiyo-ye.</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap"
  src="images/t.png" alt="T" /></div>
<p class="pfirst">HE Torii School was pre-eminently the exponent of the
drama. It was bound up with stage development and
ministered to the emotional temperament of the nation;
leading in what may be considered a national obsession,
a mania for actors and actor-prints.</p>

<p>A fascinating subject is this century of dramatic evolution fostered
by the printers’ branch of the Popular School. The actor had
been consigned, in dark feudal days, to the lowest rung in the ladder
of caste, ranking next to the outcast (<i>Eta</i>), as in early English days
the strolling player was associated with tinkers and the other vagrant
population.</p>

<p>The <i>No Kagura</i> and lyric drama,—suggesting the mediæval
and passion plays of Europe,—prefigured the modern drama in
Japan, but the immediate precursor of the present theatre was the
Puppet Show, a Japanese apotheosis of our Marionette performances.
It is interesting to note that Toyokuni, who M. Louis Gonse declared
has carried further than any one the power of mimetic art, and with
whose theatrical scenes we are most familiar, began his career as
a maker of dolls, and these puppets were eagerly sought for as
works of art.</p>

<p>If the aphorism “not to go to the theatre is like making one’s
toilet without a mirror,” be true, then the Japanese are justified in
their national stage passion, which overshadows the love of any
other amusement. Taking the phrase literally, it was to the persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
of the actors, and the printers who spread their pictures
broadcast, that the people owed the æsthetic wonders
of their costume. The designers were also artists, as
instanced by Hishigawa Moronobu, the Kyoto designer
and Yedo embroiderer, the printer and painter, illustrator of books
and originator of Ukiyo-ye.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm for the portraits of actors, fostered by the Torii
printers from the foundation of the school by Kiyonobu, about 1710,
hastened no doubt the development of colour-printing. As early
as Genroku, the portrait of Danjuro, the second of the great dynasty
of actors, who by their genius helped to brighten the fortunes of the
playhouse, was sold for five cash, in the streets of the capital.</p>

<p>The combined genius of the artists, engravers and printers of
Ukiyo-ye evolved and perfected the use of the multiple colour-block.
Toward the middle of the century, under the waning powers of Torii
Kiyomitsu, successor to Kiyonobu, the school seemed sinking into
oblivion, for Harunobu, its rightful exponent, filled with visions of
ethereal refinement, scorned the theatrical arena. When most needed,
however, a prophet arose in the person of Shunsho, the painter, the
pupil of Shunsui and master of Hokusai, thus completing the transformation
begun by Harunobu. The great scions of the rival
branches of Ukiyo-ye, printing and painting, stepped into each other’s
places and bridged the chasm, which threatened the unity of the
Popular School.</p>

<p>Both branches were united, however, in the use of the multiple
colour-blocks, but although Shunsho followed Harunobu’s experiments
in colouring, varying his actor designs with domestic scenes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
book illustrations, Harunobu resolutely refused to
portray the life of the stage, and in this determination
he was followed by his pupil and successor, Koriusai.</p>

<p>About the year 1765, the art of printing colours,
by the use of individual blocks, technically called chromo-xylography,
was perfected. It is an interesting reflection, from the standpoint
of Buddhism,—which teaches that in the fullness of time, the great
masters in religion, art and learning become reincarnated upon earth,
for the benefit of humanity, that at this period Hokusai was born,
the crowning glory and master of Ukiyo-ye. Had he appeared
earlier in the century, his genius might have been diverted to the
technical development of printing, and the world thus been the loser
of his creative flights.</p>

<p>Professor Fenollosa beautifully defines the inception of the
Ukiyo-ye print as "the meeting of two wonderfully sympathetic
surfaces,—the un-sandpapered grain of the cherry-wood block, and
a mesh in the paper, of little pulsating vegetable tentacles. Upon
the one, colour can be laid almost dry, and to the other it may be
transferred by a delicacy of personal touch that leaves only a trace
of tint balancing lightly upon the tips of the fibres. And from the
interstices of these printed tips, the whole luminous heart of the
paper wells up from within, diluting the pigment with a soft golden
sunshine. In the Japanese print we have flatness combined with
vibration."</p>

<p>To the connoisseur, one of the most important considerations,
scarcely secondary to that of colouring, in the selection of Ukiyo-ye
gems, is this vibratory quality, depending equally upon the texture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
of the paper and the magnetic pressure of the master
printer’s fingers. This characteristic seems to have
vanished from the modern print, and cannot be imitated,
though the enthusiasm for fine specimens has flooded
the market with spurious antiques, deceptive to the uninitiated. In
the exquisite reproductions of the early Ukiyo-ye prints and paintings
now being issued,—though a joy to the student unable to acquaint
himself with the originals,—this ineffable effect of vibration
is lost, probably owing to the substitution of a less sympathetic medium
than the luminous vehicle of the early impressions.</p>

<p>The actual process of wood-cutting seems a simple art, but a
close study of the making of prints will show the consummate skill
required to produce them. The artist’s design was transferred by
tracing paper, then pasted on to the face of the wood block, and
the white space hollowed out with a knife and small gouges. After
the block had been inked, a sheet of damp paper was laid upon it,
and the back of the paper was then rubbed with a flat rubber till
the impression was uniformly transferred. Where more than one
block was employed, as in colour-printing, the subsequent impressions
were registered by marks made at the corners of the paper. The
colouring matter laid upon these early blocks was extracted by mysterious
processes from sources unknown to the Western world, which,
alas! by supplying the Eastern market with cheap pigments, led to
the deterioration of art in this essential particular.</p>

<p>From 1765 to 1780 the school of Ukiyo-ye was dominated by
four great artists and creators of separate styles: Harunobu, succeeded
by Koriusai, taking for motive the subjects of Shunsui;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Shunsho of Katsukawa (changed by Shunsui from its
former title of Miyagawa), upon whose shoulders had
fallen the mantle of the Torii; Shigemasa, working
upon Shunsho’s lines, but breaking into a rival academy,
the Kitao; Toyoharu, pupil of old Torii Toyonobu, founder of the
school of Utagawa, whose most illustrious pupil was Toyokuni, the
doll-maker, and brother of Toyohiro, Hiroshige’s master. (Kunisada,
noted for his backgrounds, succeeded Toyokuni, and after the
death of his master signed himself Toyokuni the Second.)</p>

<p>Shunsho is considered one of the greatest artists of Japan, both
as an inventor and powerful colourist. M. Louis Gonse says:
"All the collections of coloured prints which are today the delight
of the tea-houses; all the fine compositions showing magnificent landscapes
and sumptuous interiors; all those figures of actors with heroic
gestures and impassive faces behind the grinning masks, and with
costumes striking and superb,—came originally from the atelier of
Katsukawa Shunsho, who had for a time the monopoly of them."
While the Torii artists were beguiling the Yedo populace with theatrical
portraiture, and aiding the growing tendency toward cosmopolitanism
by issuing printed albums, books of travel and encyclopedias,
art was also expanding at the ancient capital, Kyoto.
Sukenobu, the prolific artist, was bringing out beautifully illustrated
books, and Okio, from sketching on the earth with bamboo sticks,
while following his father and mother to their work in the fields,
had risen to be the great founder of the Maruyama school of painting,
and the Shijo or naturalistic school was named from the street
in which was the studio of the master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>The Popular School, aided by Okio, effected a
revolution in the laws of painting at Kyoto, for the
Torii artists forsook their academic methods, painting birds,
flowers, grass, quadrupeds, insects and fishes from
nature. Okio’s name ranks high among the great masters of Japanese
art, of whom so many fanciful legends are told. The charming
artist with brush and pen, John La Farge, says: “As the fruit
painted by the Greek deceived the birds, and the curtain painted
by the Greek painter deceived his fellow-artist, so the horses of
Kanaoka have escaped from their kakemonos, and the tigers sculptured
in the lattices of temples have been known to descend at night
and rend one another in the courtyards.”</p>

<p>Then the story is told of a moonlight picture, which, when unrolled,
filled a dark room with light. A pretty legend of Tanyu,
the great Kano artist, and the crabs at Enryaku Temple, is given by
Adachi Kinnotsuke. Upon one panel of the <i>fusuma</i>, or paper
screen, is seen a crab, marvellously realistic, only with claws invisible.
On the other panels the artist had painted its companions,
and at the bidding of his patron furnished them with claws. “Nevertheless,”
the master declared, “I warn you that if I give these crabs
claws they will surely crawl out of the picture.” As the visitor
glances from the wonderful counterfeit crab to the four empty panels
beside it, he knows the old master had only spoken the truth.</p>

methods of the early

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>And so with Okio. He breathed into his pictures the breath
of life. His animals live, and his flights of storks swoop across the
great kakemonos, each bird with an individuality of its own, though
one of a multitude of flying companions. To view Okio aright,
we should see him at home in his own environment, not
in Europe, where so many copies of his masterpieces
abound. John La Farge gives us a glimpse of an
Okio, fitly set, framed in oriental magnificence, in the
Temple of Iyemitsu at Nikko: “All within was quiet, in a golden
splendour. Through the small openings of the black and gold gratings
a faint light from below left all the golden interior in a summer
shade, within which glittered on golden tables the golden utensils of
the Buddhist ceremonial. The narrow passage makes the center,
through whose returning walls project, in a curious refinement of
invention, the golden eaves of the inner building beyond. Gratings,
which were carved, and gilded trellises of exquisite design, gave a
cool, uncertain light. An exquisite feeling of gentle solemnity filled
the place. In the corridor facing the mountain and the tomb, a
picture hangs on the wall. It is by Okio. Kuwannon, the Compassionate,
sits in contemplation beside the descending stream of
life.”</p>

<p>About 1775 arose a legitimate successor to the school of Torii in
the adopted son of Kiyomitsu, Kiyonaga. He discarded the theatrical
tradition of his school, but the boldness of his drawing was foreign to
the style of Harunobu. “His brush had a superhuman power and
swing.” He rivalled the three great masters, Koriusai, Shigemasa,
founder of Kitao, and Toyoharu of Utagawa, and the masters of
Ukiyo-ye, forsaking their individual predilections, flocked to his
studio.</p>

<p>The simplicity and dignity of the early Italian masters, sought
after and adored by the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, their noble lines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
and contours, are again realized in the panels of
Kiyonaga. Professor Fenollosa said that “classic”
is the instinctive term to apply to Kiyonaga, and that
his figures at their best may be placed side by side with
Greek vase painting. Ideally beautiful is the fall of his drapery,
determining the lines of the figure in the fewest possible folds. In
indoor scenes he almost rivalled Harunobu, but he loved best to paint
in the open air. In imagination we see Kiyonaga, the lover of beauty,
gazing at the wealth of lotus blooms which fill the moats of feudal
Yedo, and in the crucible of his fancy transmuting them into the
forms of women. The lotus, of all flowers, has the deepest art
significance, and is the oldest motive. The author of “Greek Lines,”
Henry Van Brunt, said: “The lotus perpetually occurs in oriental
mythology as the sublime and hallowed symbol of the productive
power of nature. The Hindu and the Egyptian instinctively elevated
it to the highest and most cherished place in their Pantheons.”</p>

<p>It is the flower of religion, of beauty, and of love. From the
ocean the Hindu Aphrodite, Lachsmi, ascended. Isis in Egypt
reigned, crowned by the lotus, and there the tender, flowing lines became
sublime, monumental, fitted to symbolize death and eternal repose.
In Japan its joyous curves represent life, immortality, and,
delicately sensuous, they conjure up visions of ideal beauty. The
lotus, sweetly blooming before the artist’s eye, expanded into a vision
of fair women, whose lissom forms he clothed with swirls of drapery.
And the women of Japan, enamoured of these enchanting poses,
endeavoured to assume the curves of Kiyonaga, sheathing their delicate
limbs in silken draperies, and simulating in their enchanting slenderness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the stems of flowers—or, to borrow a beautiful
simile from Lafcadio Hearn, “looking like a beautiful
silver moth robed in the folding of its own wings.”</p>

<p>It is said that every Japanese actor-print was
a potential poster, and, alas! the fashion-plate is endeavouring to
mold itself upon the most exaggerated type of the degenerate offspring
of the genius of the Torii School.</p>

<p>The Japanese woman, with her untrammelled form arrayed in
draperies designed by consummate artists, may dare to follow classic
Kiyonaga—youth and grace may acquire oriental plasticity. But
let fashion rest there. Pitiful and ludicrously futile is the effort of
embonpoint to attain sinuosity. Lines of beauty cannot be manufactured;
as well imagine the slender stem of the lotus encircled in
steel, its curves determined by a multiplicity of wires and tapes.</p>

<p>Although the leaders of Ukiyo-ye followed so closely in the
footsteps of Kiyonaga that his type of face stamps the years from
1780 to 1790, yet his style was too classic, too noble to suit the
taste of the Yedo populace, which, in its thirst for realism, had
become depraved. Rather than lower his standard he chose to
resign, leaving the field to his followers, Yeishi, Utamaro and
Toyokuni. These masters, at first as dignified in their method as
Kiyonaga, now yielded to the public craze for the exaggerated, the
abnormal and grotesque. It was an apotheosis of ugliness and vulgarity,
a “Zolaism in prints.”</p>

<p>Coarse pictures of actors, masquerading in female dress, replaced
the charming little domestic women of Harunobu and Koriusai,—the
ladies of Japan, as we see them in reality,—and the noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
figures of Kiyonaga. Gigantic courtesans, bizarre and
fantastic, with delirious headgear, took the place of
Shunsho’s fair children of the “Underworld,” who,
in the modesty of their mien, seemed to belie the calling
they so often deplored, as the songs of the Yoshiwara testify,
plaintively sung to the syncopated rhythm of the samisen, tinkling
through the summer nights.</p>

<p>The school of Ukiyo-ye was sinking into obscurity, when
Hiroshige and Hokusai appeared, two children of light, dispersing
the gloom: Hiroshige, the versatile painter, lover of landscape and
ethereal artist of snow and mist; Hokusai, the prophet, and regenerator
of Ukiyo-ye. He was the artisan-artist, in the land which
recognizes no inferior arts, and the Mang-wa, consisting of studies
as spontaneously thrown off as those in the sketch-book Giorgione
carried in his girdle, was published for the use of workmen. Living
in simplicity and poverty he gave his life to the people, and the impression
of his genius is stamped upon their work. A true handicraftsman
was Hokusai,—the Mang-wa a dictionary of the arts
and crafts, as well as the inspired vehicle of art. In it “balance,
rhythm and harmony, the modes in which Beauty is revealed, both in
nature and art,” were manifested,—for he was a vital artist, laying
bare the enigma of evolution, and the mystery of creation.</p>

</div>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap"
  src="images/t.png" alt="T" /></div>
<p class="pfirst">HE above title is quoted from the work of M. Edmond
de Goncourt, “as one having authority,” there being
many claimants to the leadership of Ukiyo-ye (the
floating world), the Popular School of Japanese Art.
In the life of Utamaro, M. de Goncourt, in exquisite language and
with analytical skill, has interpreted for us the meaning of that form
of Japanese art which found its chief expression in the use of the
wooden block for colour-printing, and to glance appreciatively at the
work of both artist and author is the motive of this sketch.</p>

<p>The Ukiyo-ye print, despised by the haughty Japanese aristocracy,
became the vehicle of art for the common people of Japan,
and the names of the artists who aided in its development are familiarly
quoted in every studio, whilst the classic painters of “Tosa”
and “Kano” are comparatively rarely mentioned. The consensus
of opinion in Japan during the lifetime of Utamaro agrees with the
verdict of M. de Goncourt. No artist was more popular. His
atelier was besieged by editors giving orders, and in the country his
works were eagerly sought after, when those of his famous contemporary,
Toyokuni, were but little known. In the “Barque of
Utamaro,” a famous surimono, the title of which forms a pretty play
upon words, <i>maro</i> being the Japanese for vessel, the seal of supremacy
is set upon the artist. Here he is represented as holding court in a
gaily decorated barge, surrounded by a bevy of beauty paying
homage to his genius. He was essentially the painter of women,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
and though M. de Goncourt sets forth his astonishing
versatility, he yet entitles his work, “Outamaro, le
Peintre des Maisons Vertes.”</p>

<p>The beautiful inhabitants of these celebrated
houses of the Yoshiwara (the flower quarter) of Yedo had ever
been sought as models by the artists of Ukiyo-ye. But, alas! the
sensuous poetic-artistic temperament of Utamaro, undisciplined and
uncontrolled, led to his undoing. The pleasure-loving artist, recognizing
no creed but the worship of beauty, refusing to be bound by
any fetters but those of fancy, fell at last into the lowest depths
of degradation, physical and moral. And this debasement of their
leader, tainting his art, was reflected in the work of his brother
artists and hastened the decadence of the Popular School.</p>

<p>To understand the influences which sapped the self-control of
the gay and beauty-loving Utamaro, we have only to glance at the
text by Jipensha Ikkou of “The Annuary of the Green Houses,”
two volumes of prints in colour, so marvellously beautiful that they
caused the artist to be recognized as, in a sense, the official painter
of the Yoshiwara. The writer thus sums up the fatal fascination
of the inmates, the courtesans of highest rank, who alone were depicted
by Utamaro. “The daughters of the Yoshiwara are brought
up like princesses. From infancy they are given the most finished
education” (from the Japanese standpoint, be it observed). “They
are taught reading, writing, art, music, <i>le thé</i>, <i>le parfum</i>” (in the game
of scents, the art is to guess by inhaling the odour of burning perfumes
the secret of their composition). “Their entourage is that of princesses,
brought up in the seclusion of the palace. Coming from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
all parts of the ‘Land of the Rising Sun,’ they must
discard their individual patois and learn to speak the
archaic tongue, slightly modified, the poetical, the noble
language of the court from the seventeenth to the nineteenth
century.”</p>

<p>In the home of the celebrated Tsutaya Juzabro, who edited the
most beautiful books of the time, in his early impressionable youth
lived Utamaro, within a stone’s throw of the great gate leading to
the Yoshiwara. By day he devoted himself to his art, by night he
surrendered himself to the fatal enchantment of that brilliant “Underworld,”
until, like Merlin, ensnared by Vivian, with the charm of
“woven paces and waving hands,” his art sapped by excesses, he
became “lost to life, and use, and name, and fame.”</p>

<p>Let us, forgetting this sad sequel, glance at the works which
testify to the life of high artistic endeavour led by Utamaro in the
early part of his career. In the preface to the “Yehon Moushi
Yerabi” (Chosen Insects), the master of Utamaro, Toriyama Sekiyen,
throws so charming a sidelight upon the youth of the artist,
that the temptation to quote is irresistible. The value of these Japanese
prefaces to the world, to workers in every field, is incalculable.
At the outset of his work, M. de Goncourt alludes to the well-known
preface of Hokusai in the “Fugaku Hiak’kei,” and doubtless fortified
himself by the stimulating example of the old master, when undertaking
at the age of seventy the great task of presenting to the Western
world, under the title of “L’Art Japonais,” a history of five noted
painters, besides that of other artists in bronze and lacquer, pottery
and iron—artists in a land where the terms artist and artisan are interchangeable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
the only country where art industrial
almost always touches grand art.</p>

<p>The translator of the preface of Sekiyen is gratefully
referred to by M. de Goncourt as “l’intelligent,
le savant, l’aimable M. Hyashi.” It may be considered a revolutionary
manifesto of the Profane School, the school of real life, in opposition
to the hierarchical Buddhist academies of Kano and Tosa,
which had become stultified by tradition and stifled by conventional
observances.</p>

<p>“Préface écrite par Toriyama Sekiyen, le maître d’Outamaro,
célébrant le naturisme (sorti du cœur) de son petit, de son cher élève
Outa.” "Reproduire la vie par le cœur, et en dessiner la structure
au pinceau, est la loi de la peinture. L’étude que vient de publier
maintenant, mon élève Outamaro, reproduit la vie même du monde
des insectes. C’est la vraie peinture du cœur. Et quand je me
souviens d’autrefois, je me rappelle que dès l’enfance, le petit Outa,
observait le plus infini détail des choses. Ainsi à l’automne, quand
il était dans le jardin, il se mettait en chasse des insectes, et que ce
soit un criquet où une sauterelle, avait-il fait une prise, il gardait la
bestiole dans sa main et s’amusait à l’étudier. Et combien de fois
je l’ai grondé dans l’appréhension qu’il ne prenne l’habitude, de
donner la mort à des êtres vivants. Maintenant qu’il a acquis son
grand talent du pinceau, il fait de ces études d’insectes, la gloire de
sa profession."</p>

<p>The enthusiastic master of <i>le petit Outa</i> proceeds to rhapsodize
upon his pupil’s genius and intimate knowledge of the structure of
insects. “He makes us hear,” he says, “the shrilling of the tamamoushi,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
the cicada of Japan, whose endless peevish
twanging upon one string forms an underlying accompaniment
to the harmonies of long summer days. “He
borrows the light weapons of the grasshopper for making
war; he exhibits the dexterity of the earthworm, boring the soil under
the foundations of old buildings; he penetrates the mysteries of nature
in the groping of the larvæ, in the lighting of his path by the glow-worm,
and he ends by disentangling the end of the thread of the
spider’s web.”</p>

<p>The colour-printing of these insects is a miracle of art, says M.
de Goncourt, and there is nothing comparable to it in Europe. Of
the methods by which these colour prints are brought to such a
height of perfection, it is almost impossible to speak authoritatively.
They are the result of a threefold combination: of a paper marvellously
prepared from the bark of the shrub, <i>Kozo</i>, diluted with the
milk of rice flour and a gummy decoction extracted from the roots
of the hydrangea and hibiscus; of dyes, into the secret of whose
alchemy no modern artist can penetrate, it being safe to say the early
“Tan-ye” and “Beni-ye” prints can never be reproduced; of the
application of those colours by the master engraver’s fingers—that
wizard hand of the Orient into whose finger-tips are distilled the
mysteries of bygone centuries. A portion of the colour by means of
this calculated pressure is drunk, absorbed into the paper, and only
the transparency is left vibrating upon the fibres, like colour beneath
the glaze.</p>

<p>The “Catalogue Raisonné” of M. de Goncourt is a prose masterpiece.
His descriptive touches, like pastels set in jewels, captivate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
the imagination. Through him we see the albums, the
fans, the kakemonos, the surimonos. Oh, the prints,
with their wondrous backgrounds, the delight of Utamaro!
Sometimes straw-yellow, the uniformity broken
with clouds of ground mica; sometimes gray in tint, like the traces
of receding waves upon the beach. Some silvered backgrounds
throw moonlight reflections upon the figures; some are sombre, bizarre—all
are marvellous beyond words. And the colours! we cannot
define them in English. The “bleus” (malades des mauves), the
“rose” (beni) "si peu de rose, qu’ils semblent s’apercevoir à travers
un tulle; l’azur—délavé, et comme noyé dans l’eau,"—not colours,
but nuances, which recall the colours. And the “Gauffrage,” so
effective with the print artists, with us a mere confectioner’s touch!</p>

<p>It is said that “the æsthetic temperament of a nation is most
subtly felt in the use of colour. Purity, coldness, sensuality, brightness,
dullness of tints, are significant terms correlated to mental and
physical human phenomena.” The assertion of Ruskin, that “the
bodily system is in a healthy state when we can see hues clearly in
their most delicate tints, and enjoy them, fully and simply, with the
kind of enjoyment children have in eating sweet things,” is brought
to mind in viewing the Japanese people upon the occasion of one of
their great flower fêtes, feasting their eyes upon cherry blooms or
trailing clusters of the wistaria.</p>

<p>Utamaro planned schemes of colour and devised harmonies—themes
which, improvised upon and endlessly imitated by his artist
confrères, filled his own countrymen with delight and ravished the
hearts of Parisian painters. The influence of Utamaro, Hiroshige
and the other masters of Ukiyo-ye revolutionized the
colour-sense of the art world, so that Theodore Child,
writing in 1892, remarks of the Japanese influence:
“The Paris Salon of today as compared with the salon
of ten years ago is like a May morning compared with a dark
November day.”</p>

<p>The same keen observation and technical skill which would
have made Utamaro a famous naturalist is shown in his marvellous
studies of women. He was the first Japanese artist who deviated
from the traditional manner of treating the face. The academic
style demanded the nose to be suggested by one calligraphic, aquiline
stroke, the eyes to be mere slits, the mouth the curled up petal of a
flower. Utamaro blent with this convention, so little human, a
mutinous grace, a spiritual comprehension; he kept the consecrated
lines, but made them approach the human. These “effigies of
women” became individuals; in one word, he is an idealist, he “makes
a goddess out of a courtesan.” No detail of her anatomy escapes his
eye, no grace of line or beauty of contour. M. de Goncourt, in
detailing the great prints of Utamaro, transports us to the Orient.
He unrolls the film of memory, so that again the Japanese woman
stands, reclines, and lives before us.</p>

<p>“Vous avez la Japonaise en tous les mouvements intimes de son
corps; vous l’avez, dans ses appuiements de tête, sur le dos de sa
main, quand elle réfléchit, dans ses agenouillements, les paumes de
ses mains appuyées sur les cuisses, quand elle écoute, dans sa parole,
jetée de côté, la tête un peu tournée, et qui la montre dans les aspects si
joliment fuyants d’un profil perdu; vous l’avez dans sa contemplation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
amoureuse des fleurs qu’elle regarde aplatie à terre;
vous l’avez dans ses renversements où légèrement elle
pose, à demi assise, sur la balustrade d’un balcon; vous
l’avez dans ses lectures, où elle lit dans le volume, tout
près de ses yeux, les deux coudes appuyés sur ses genoux; vous l’avez
dans sa toilette qu’elle fait avec une main tenant devant elle, son petit
miroir de métal, tandis que de l’autre main passée derrière elle, elle se
caresse distraitement la nuque de son écran; vous l’avez dans le contournement
de sa main autour d’une coupe de saké, dans l’attouchement
délicat et recroquevillé de ses doigts de singe, autour des laques, des
porcelaines, des petits objets artistiques de son pays; vous l’avez
enfin, la femme de l’Empire-du-Lever-du-Soleil, en sa grace grâce languide,
et son coquet rampement sur les nattes du parquet.”</p>

<p>To translate is to travesty, for the French language seems to be
the only medium through which can be filtered the nuances of
Japanese thought, which elude the ordinary elements of language,
like the perfume of flowers, the bouquet of delicate vintages. Our
blunt Anglo-Saxon mars that picture language, where one flexible,
curved calligraphic stroke conveys to the æsthetically receptive
oriental imagination what stanzas of rhyming rhapsody fail to
define. Sir Edwin Arnold and Lafcadio Hearn approach the
French, are, so to speak, orientalized. Ordinary English fails to give
a Japanese equivalent. It is too emphatic, too objective; it suggests
the dominant British hobnail upon the delicate Tea-house tatami—that
immaculate, beautiful matting, into whose uniform lines embroidered
draperies dissolve deliciously. Oh, those dreams of dresses!—the
warp and woof of the visions of the masters of Ukiyo-ye,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
of Harunobu and Kiyonaga, Toyokuni and Kunisada,
and all the rest, the idols of Parisian colourists!</p>

<p>“For us,” says M. de Goncourt, “Utamaro painted
violet dresses, where, upon the border, <i>degradation rosée</i>”
(fading into Beni, that mystic tint, the spirit of ashes of rose),
"birds are swooping,—violet dresses, across which woven in
light, zigzag insect characters, composing the Japanese alphabet,—violet
dresses, where Corean lions, grim and ferocious,
crouch, gleaming in shading of old bronze within the purple folds!
Dresses of mauve, smoky, shading into bistre, where the purple iris
unsheathes its head from the slender gray-green stalk!" Mourasiki-ya
(maison mauve) was the name of the atelier of Utamaro. "Robes
of that milky blue the Chinese call ‘blue of the sky after the rain,’ beneath
clusters of pale rose peonies; dresses of silvery gray, fretted
with sprays of flowering shrubs, making a misty moonshine; pea-green
dresses, enamelled with rosy cherry blooms; green dresses,
fading into watery tints, hidden by groups of the pawlonia, the coat
of arms of the reigning family; purple costumes, channelled with
water courses, where mandarin ducks pursue each other around the
hem. Oh, the beautiful black backgrounds, controlling the scintillating
mass of colour! Black robes sown with chrysanthemums, or
showered with pine-needles, worked in white. Black dresses, where
finely woven baskets are mingled with sceptres of office! ‘Oh! les
belles robes!’ he cries, where flights of cranes dissolve into the
distance, where birds are fluttering, where lacy fretwork of fans and
little garlands are interwoven!—a motive delighted in by Utamaro
as a framework for beloved faces." All that is beautiful in nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
and art lived and breathed in these dresses, upon which
the loving hand of the painter left a grace in every fold.</p>

<p>The early inspirer of Utamaro’s genius was Kiyonaga,
who had restored the glory of the school of
Torii—the printer’s branch of Ukiyo-ye, which had sunk into
temporary oblivion under the waning powers of Kiyomitsu.
The atelier of Kiyonaga became the sanctuary of the artists
of Ukiyo-ye, who, upon entering, forsook their individual traditions.
There worshipped Toyokuni of Utagawa; Yeishi, the scion
of classic and aristocratic Kano; and at the master’s feet sat the
Young Utamaro, absorbing his methods until, in his early compositions,
said M. de Goncourt, the technique and mannerisms of Kiyonaga
“saute aux yeux.”</p>

<p>The influence of Kiyonaga pervades his most beautiful work; but
later, under a life of constant self-indulgence, amongst associations all
tending to demoralization, his genius suffered an eclipse. His loss
of self-control affected his art, until the sweeping lines and noble
contours which his brush had acquired in the atelier of Kiyonaga
were lost or widely travestied into a “delirium of female tallness.”
In these wild flights his brother artists followed in headlong pursuit,
and the contagion of the movement swept the studios of Paris. In
the modern poster we see the degenerate offspring of the genius of
Utamaro, and of Toyokuni. Professor Fenollosa said, “The generation
of Aubrey Beardsley prefer these tricks to the sober grace of
Harunobu, Kiyonaga and Koriusai.” It is art born of excess, a
“Zolaism in prints.”</p>

<p>The horrors of diseased imagination, the visions begotten of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
absinthe, which blot the brilliant pages of De Maupassant
and the verse of Paul Verlaine, were reflected
by Utamaro in his studies of the loathsome and the
abnormal, where Montaigne declares, “L’esprit faisant le
cheval eschappé, enfante des chimères.” The blasphemous impieties
of this culte, deplored by all true Frenchmen, in the country of Hugo
and Molière, were distanced by Utamaro, who suborned his art, his
cynical brush caricaturing under the distorted figures of noted courtesans
the saints and sages of the sacred Buddhist legends. Trading
upon his vast popularity, he issued a pictorial satire upon one of the
famous Shoguns, but this act of lèse-majesté brought him into disfavour
with the reigning Shogun, the Louis XV of Japan, an artistic
voluptuary, like his prototype, the subject of Utamaro’s cartoon, and
the artist was condemned and cast into prison. From his cell the gay
butterfly of the Yoshiwara emerged, spent and enfeebled, daring no
more flights of fancy, and dying in 1806, before he reached his fiftieth
year, from the effects of his confinement and the misuse of pleasure.</p>

<p>Oh, the pity of it! the profound pathos in the picture, in Sekiyen’s
preface of the little “Outa” holding his treasured prize, "la petite
bestiole,"—the childish artist-hands of the embryo master clasping
the insect so gently to preserve its ephemeral life, yet later plunging
into the dissipation and excesses which shortened his own. Living
with the déclassé, however we may gloss their imperfections and
cover with the cloak of charity their sorrowful calling, he became
himself a cynic, an outcast, an iconoclast, learning that "hardening of
the heart which brings</p>

<p>
“Irreverence for the dreams of youth.”<br >
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>Though Utamaro was one of the greatest of the
popular artists, his demoralization led to the decadence
of his school, which later was regenerated by the great
master of Ukiyo-ye, Hokusai, the artist of the people.
In Hokusai, “Dreaming the things of Heaven and of Buddha,”
breathed the pure spirit of art,—that Spirit of poetry and purity
which calls to us in Milton’s immortal lines:</p>

<p>“<i>From the age of six, I had a mania for drawing the forms of
things. By the time I was fifty, I had published an infinity of designs,
but all I have produced before the age of seventy is not worth taking
into account. At seventy-five I have learned a little about the real
structure of nature,—of animals, plants and trees, birds, fishes and
insects. In consequence, when I am eighty, I shall have made still
more progress. At ninety I shall penetrate the mystery of things; at
a hundred I shall certainly have reached a marvellous stage, and when
I am a hundred and ten, everything I do—be it but a line or dot—will
be alive. I beg those who live as long as I, to see if I do not
keep my word. Written at the age of seventy-five by me,—once
Hokusai,—today Gwakio-rojin, ‘the old man, mad about drawing.’</i>”</p>
</div>
<hr class="small" />

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap"
  src="images/a.png" alt="A" /></div>
<p class="pfirst"><i>RS longa, vita brevis</i>," though a time-worn aphorism,
seems the best comment upon these words of Hokusai,
which preface the “Fugaku Hiak’kei” (Hundred Views
of Fuji). Judging from what he had accomplished,
before his death in 1849, at the age of eighty-nine, and the continual
increase in his powers, it is easy to believe that had his life been extended
to the limit he craved, the prophecy would have been fulfilled.</p>

<p>M. Louis Gonse says of Hokusai, "He is the last and most brilliant
figure of a progress of more than ten centuries—the exuberant
and exquisite product of a time of profound peace and incomparable
refinement."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>From the standpoint of Buddhism, Hokusai was
the crowning glory, the supreme efflorescence of countless
previous incarnations. In his career he epitomized
the theory of evolution, the embryonic stages being exemplified
by his progress through the schools. Trained in the atelier
of Shunsho, the most skillful exponent of Ukiyo-ye art, he rapidly
absorbed the methods of his master; but even the Popular School
was trammelled by convention, and Hokusai’s genius, rejecting academic
fetters, winged its flight through all the realms of oriental art.</p>

<p>He drank at the fountain-head of China, then absorbed the
traditions of the “two great streams of Kano and Tosa, which flowed
without mixing to the middle of the eighteenth century.” Kano,
springing from Chinese models, was transformed by the genius of
Masanobu and his followers, and became the most illustrious school
of painting in Japan. It was the official school of the Shoguns, in
opposition to "Tosa"—that elegant and exquisite appanage of the
Mikados, which represented aristocratic taste.</p>

<p>The Tosa school is characterized by extreme delicacy of execution
and fine use of the brush, as in Persian miniature painting. The
splendour of the screens of Tosa has never been surpassed, with their
precious harmonies in colour and delicate designs (so often imitated
in lacquer), against glorious backgrounds in rich gold-leaf.</p>

<p>He studied the technique of Okio, founder of the school of
realism, which, maturing at Kyoto, led up to “Ukiyo-ye,” the popular
art of the masses of Yedo. Ukiyo-ye, literally “The Floating
World,” despised by the ascetic disciples of Buddha and Confucius
for picturing the gay world of fashion and folly, was the name of
the school which liberated Japanese art from the
shackles of centuries of tradition.</p>

  <div class="caption">Two Ladies.
By Hokusai.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>Ukiyo-ye is the supreme expression, the concentrated
essence of the schools, a river of art whose fount was
India, Persia and China. For centuries it was forced into narrow
channels by the haughty and exclusive aristocracy; but ever widening,
its branches at last united and swept into their joyous current the
common people of Japan, who, intuitively art lovers, had ever thirsted
for the living stream. Now they beheld themselves reflected, in all
the naturalness of daily life, yet with a spiritual rendering, “appealing,”
said Jarves, "to those intuitions with which the soul is freighted when
it first comes to earth, whose force is ever manifested by a longing for
an ideal not of the earth, and whose presence can only be explained
as an augury of a superior life to be, or else the dim reminiscence of
one gone; and the recognition of this ideal is the touchstone of art—art
which then becomes the solution of immortality."</p>

<p>The originators of Ukiyo-ye, which included in its scope painting
proper, book illustration and single-sheet pictorial prints, were Iwasa
Matahei and Moronobu, followed in long succession by Shunsui,
the precursor of Hokusai’s master, Shunsho; and united with it
were the engravers of the Torii school, culminating in Kiyonaga (with
whose grace and beauty of line Hokusai could never compete), the
refined offshoot of the Kitao, and the elegant scion of Kano—Yeishi.</p>

<p>Hokusai’s individuality and independence long galled his master,
and a final rupture was caused by the pupil’s enthusiasm for the bold
and sweeping, black-and-white, calligraphic strokes of Kano. Then
began a hard struggle for the youthful artist, who had no money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
and no influence. His father was a maker of metal
mirrors, Hokusai’s real name being Nakajima Tetsu
Jiro, but his pseudonyms were legion. In the atelier
of Shunsho, he was called Shunro,—taking with the
other disciples of this school of Katsukawa, the first syllable of his
master’s name.</p>

<p>Cast adrift upon the streets of Yedo, he sold red pepper, and
hawked almanacs, at the same time constantly studying, and seizing
the best ideas from all the schools. Blent with an intuitive instinct
for art, the Japanese nature is essentially histrionic, and throughout
the whole career of Hokusai there is an element which is genuinely
dramatic. C. J. Holmes, in his beautiful work on Hokusai, gives
many romantic incidents in the artist’s life, and was it not by a
theatrical <i>tour de force</i> that he first won popular favour?</p>

<p>He chose no doubt a national holiday, perhaps the festival of
“Cherry Viewing,” when Uyeno Park is thronged with sightseers
of every station in life. Here in the heart of the great city of Tokyo
is a hallowed spot—majestic, grand and peaceful, where in mystic
solemnity the sacred cedars enshrine that wondrous necropolis of illustrious
dead,—for at Uyeno lie buried six of the famous Shoguns.</p>

<p>In the courtyard of one of the temples, Hokusai erected a rough
scaffolding, upon which was spread a sheet of paper, eighteen yards
long and eleven in width. Here in the sacred heart of Japan, with
tubs of water and tubs of ink, the master and predestined genius of
his country manifested his power. He swept his huge brush this way
and that, the crowd constantly increasing in density, many scaling
the temple roof to see the marvellous feat,—a colossal figure, springing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
into life at the touch of the creator. All who
know his work can in imagination picture the grand
sweeping curves and graduated shadings that the magic
broom evolved; and the artistic people gazed spell-bound,
while many a murmured “Naruhodo!” (Wonderful) and
sibilant inhalation of the breath marked their recognition of the
master’s power.</p>

<p>Displaying less of the artist than the genius at legerdemain were
Hokusai’s street tricks—almost reprehensible did we not know the
dire straits to which genius is often reduced. An eager expectant
crowd dogged his footsteps and watched with delighted curiosity,
while he sketched landscapes, upside down, with an egg or a bottle,
or a wine measure, anything that came to his hand,—changing with
bewildering effect from huge figures of Chinese heroes and demigods
to microscopic drawings on grains of rice, and pictures made out
of chance blots of ink.</p>

<p>His fame was noised abroad, and at last reached the ears of the
Shogun, and now an unprecedented honour was conferred upon the
humble apostle of the artisan, for he was summoned before the august
presence to give an exhibition of his skill. The Japanese are ever
imitative, and Hokusai may have borne in mind the legend of his
prototype Sesshiu, an artist-priest of the fifteenth century, who
sketched before the Emperor of China a marvellous dragon, with
splashes from a broom plunged in ink.</p>

<p>Still more spectacular and theatrical was Hokusai’s debut, for,
spreading a sheet of paper before the feet of the monarch, he covered
it with a blue wash,—then seizing a live cock, he daubed its feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
with a red pigment, and let it run over the wet colour,
when the Shogun and his astonished courtiers beheld a
flowing stream of liquid blue, upon which appeared to
float filmy segregated petals of red maple leaves. A
mere trick!—unworthy of genius, we might say, but Hokusai had
gauged his countrymen, and knew that his <i>jeu d’esprit</i> would arouse
and impress these aristocratic connoisseurs, jaded with ceremonial
observances, more than any display of technical knowledge,—for the
Japanese, as a nation, are naively childish in their love of novelty
and amusement, and of the unusual and bizarre.</p>

<p>Is it not possible that this trickery of the master may have unconsciously
supplied the motive for Hiroshige’s famous print of a
Yedo suburb, chosen by Professor Fenollosa, in his beautiful work
on Ukiyo-ye,—where he so poetically says, "the orange fire of maples
deepens the blue of marshy pools"?</p>

<p>Space does not permit any detailed description of the compositions
of Hokusai, and there is no complete catalogue of his works,
the one nearest to accuracy being M. Edmond de Goncourt’s <i>Catalogue
raisonné</i>. His fecundity was marvellous. He illustrated
books of all kinds, poetry, comic albums, accounts of travels,—in fact
his works are an encyclopedia of Japanese life. His paintings are
scattered, and countless numbers lost, many being merely ephemeral
drawings, thrown off for the passing pleasure of the populace. The
original designs for the prints were transferred to the blocks,
and lost, though the master rigidly superintended the reproduction
of his works, and his wood-cutters were trained to follow the
graceful sweeping curves with perfect accuracy, many of his
compositions being ruled across for exact reduction.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>Ukiyo-ye art is bound up with print development,
and the climax of xylography had been reached in the
time of Hokusai. Japanese book illustration, and
single-sheet printing, revolutionized the world’s art. The great connoisseurs
of colour tell us that nowhere else is there anything like it,—so
rich and so full, that a print comes to have every quality of a complete
painting.</p>

<p>Hokusai had served a four years’ apprenticeship to the school of
engraving, and his practiced eye was ever ready to detect any inaccuracy
in his workmen. “I warn the engraver,” he said, "not
to add an eyeball underneath when I do not draw one. As to the
nose, these two are mine,"—here he draws a nose in front and in
profile,—“I will not have the nose of Utagawa.” The greatest
difference exists in the beauty and colouring of the impressions, and
the amateur, in his search for Ukiyo-ye gems, should not trust his
unaided judgment.</p>

<p>M. Louis Gonse said of the surimono, “To me they are the most
seductive morsels of Japanese art.” They are small, oblong prints,
composed as programmes for festive occasions with a text of verse
enriched by exquisite illustration. The surimono of Hokusai showed
the influence of Tosa, the decoration being very elaborate, and delicate
as a Persian miniature. In places, the surface of the print is
goffered for ornament in relief, and the colouring is enforced by
inlaying in gold, silver, bronze and tin.</p>

<p>Some of the best examples of Hokusai’s art are the “Waterfalls,”
the “Bridges,” "Thirty-six Views of Fuji," the “Gwafu,” the “Hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Views of Fuji” (of which the finest edition was
brought out in London with a commentary by Mr.
F. V. Dickins), and the fifteen volumes of the "Mang-wa,"—a
term hardly translatable, but signifying fugitive
sketches, or drawing as it comes, spontaneously. The preface best
gives us the intention of the master.</p>

<p>“Under the roof of Boksenn, in Nagoya, he dreamed and drew
some three hundred compositions. The things of Heaven and of
Buddha, the life of men and women, even birds and beasts, plants
and trees, he has included them all, and under his brush every phase
and form of existence has arisen. The master has tried to give life
to everything he has painted, and the joy and happiness so faithfully
expressed in his work are a plain proof of his victory.”</p>

<p>Hokusai has been called the king of the artisans, and it was
for them especially that he composed the drawings of Mang-wa.
His influence is expressed in all their works: in the structure of the
roofs of temples, in houses and their interiors; upon the things of every-day
life, as upon flowers and landscapes, upon lacquer, inros and
netsukis, bronzes and ivory.</p>

<p>Gustave Geffroy truly gauged the genius of Hokusai in speaking
of his “flights beyond the horizon.” In the master we recognize
the creator. He feels the mystery of the birth of mountains, as in
that weird composition of Fuji, where the great cone is seen rising
above circle upon circle of serpentine coils, forming the mystic tomoyé—symbol
of creation and eternity. He feels the pulsation of the
universe, and the life of ocean, and in a frenzy of creative power,
beneath his hand the curved crests of foaming waves break into life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
flashing into countless sea-birds born of the froth of
ocean. He is the painter of chimera, the prophet of cataclysm;
he “gives the world a shake and invents chaos.”
How vivid is Holmes’ description of the wave in the
seventh Mang-wa!</p>

<p>“Man becomes a mere insect, crouching in his frail catamaran,
as the giant billow topples and shakes far above him. The convention
of black lines with which he represents falling rain is as
effectual as his conventions for water are fanciful. The storm of
Rembrandt, of Rubens, or of Turner, is often terrible but never really
wet; Constable gets the effect of wetness, but his storms are not
terrible. Hokusai knows how a gale lashes water into foam, and
bows the tree before it; how the gusts blow the people hither and
thither, how sheets of drenching rain half veil a landscape, how the
great white cone of his beloved Fuji gleams through a steady downpour!
His lightning is rather odd in comparison with the realistic
studies of the great artists of Europe, but what European ever tried
an effect so stupendous as that recorded in ‘Fugaku Hiak’kei,’ where
the snowy top of Fuji is seen at evening, crimson with the last fiery
rays of sunset, while all the flanks of the mountain are hidden by a
dark storm-cloud, through which the lightning flashes!”</p>

<p>Poetry and art are ever allied, and the vibrations of genius
encircle the globe. Byron and Ruskin and Hokusai were contemporaries.
Possibly at the very moment when the poet was
immortalizing himself by composing his “Storm in the Alps,” the
grand “old man, mad about drawing,” was sketching the peerless
mountain:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent40">“Far along</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leaps the loud thunder! not from one lone cloud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But every mountain now hath found a tongue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Jura answers through her misty shroud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Back to the joyous Alps, who call to her aloud.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lord Byron’s vivid pen also best describes the squally storms of
both Hiroshige and Hokusai,—where</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The big rain comes dancing to the earth.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="pnind">Was not Hokusai truly "a portion of the tempest"? as he represents
himself, drawing Fuji, in winter, working in a frenzy of haste,—for
the ground is covered with snow—two brushes in his hand, and
wonder of wonders! one held between his toes. This picture, also
from “The Hundred Views of Fuji,” prefaces Marcus B. Huish’s
work on Japanese art.</p>

<p>The closing scene in the drama of Hokusai’s life is full of pathos.
Though his whole career had been shadowed by poverty, and
shrouded in obscurity, his art still held him earth-bound. Upon his
death-bed he said, “If Heaven would only grant me ten more years!”</p>

<p>Then, as he realized that the end approached, he murmured, “If
Heaven had but granted me five more years I could have been
a real painter.”</p>

<p>So ended the life of the master of Ukiyo-ye. His body lies
beneath the pines of Asakusa, but would we not gladly believe that
his "soul turned Will-o’-the-wisp, may ever come and go at ease,
over the summer fields,"—for this was the last expression of his passionate
desire.</p>

<p class="pfirst">F the lovely “Land of the Rising Sun” should, during one of
those volcanic throes which threaten her extinction, sink forever
beneath the depths of ocean, she would yet live for us
through the magic brush of Hiroshige. Gazing at his landscapes,
the airy wing of imagination wafts us to a land of
showers and sunsets—a fairy scene, where the rainbow falls to earth,
shattered into a thousand prisms—where waters softly flow towards
horizons touched with daffodil or azure tinted.</p>

<p>Here is a gliding <i>sampan</i> with closed shutters. Inside, the lantern’s
diffused light throws a silhouette upon the bamboo curtain, a
drooping girlish head bending towards the unseen lover at her feet.
Ripples play upon the water, stirred by the amorous breath of oriental
night. In fancy we hear the tinkling of the samisen, touched
by delicate fingers, sweetly perfumed.</p>

<p>Now we see rain upon the Tokaido. A skurrying storm. Affrighted
coolies running this way and that. A mountain full of echoes
and horror. Down it splash rivulets, running into inky pools. Darkness
and terror and loneliness, and longing for warmth and shelter and
the peace of home.</p>

<p>In marked contrast is one of the “Seven Impressions of Hakone.”
A glad reveille. The sun breaks out, the clouds have burst asunder,
masses of vapour float here and there. All is chaotic, untamed, a
palette wildly mingled.</p>

<p>The Japanese so dearly love Nature, in all her moods, that when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
she dons her mantle of snow they hesitate, even when necessity
compels, to sully its purity. In one of Utamaro’s
prints, sweetly entitled by M. Edmond de Goncourt “La
Nature Argentée,” a little musüme is seen searching the
snowy landscape she loves, and, hating to blot the beautiful carpet,
she cries, “Oh, the beautiful new snow! Where shall I throw the tea-leaves?”
With Hiroshige, the artist of snow and mist, we feel this
love, and so successfully, does he deal with a snowy landscape that
we see the snow in masses, luminous, soft and unsullied, as if Nature
had lent a helping hand to portray her pure white magic. So, without
formula or technique, but absolutely and sincerely, he unrolls the
winter pageant before us.</p>

<p>The Japanese landscape painter sums up nature in broad lines, to
which all details are more or less subordinated. This rendering of
the momentary vision of life and light,—the spirit, not the letter of
the scene,—is what is meant by Impressionism. Whereas, however
the French impressionists express light by modelling surfaces, the
Japanese adhere rigidly to line, and rely upon gradations of colour
and the effect of washes to produce the illusion of light. Their landscape
is expressed in clear-cut lines and flat masses of colour. In the
prints this virtue of abstract line is exemplified, the outline being the
essential element of the composition, for upon line and arrangements
of balanced colour the artist must depend, cramped as he is by the
necessities of the wood-cut. And here he displays his wonderful ingenuity,
his fineness of gradations and opposition, his boldness and
infinity of device, and in spite of the limitations which hamper him, he
realizes absolute values in the narrowest range, by
virtue of his knowledge of lines and spaces.</p>

<p>“No scientifically taught artist,” said Jarves, “can
get into as few square inches of paper a more distinct
realization of space, distance, atmosphere, perspective and landscape
generally, not to mention sentiment and feeling.”</p>

<p>This virtue of the line is the inheritance of the Japanese, the consummate
handling of the brush almost a racial instinct. From China,
far back in the centuries, came the sweeping calligraphic stroke, of
which in Japan the school of Kano became the noblest exponent.
“<i>L’école</i>,” said M. de Goncourt, “<i>des audaces et de la bravoure du
faire, l’école tantôt aux écrasements du pinceau, tantôt aux ténuités
d’un cheveu.</i>”</p>

<p>As soon as the tiny hand of the Japanese baby can grasp the
brush its art education begins. The brush is the Japanese alphabet—it
is their fairy wand, their playmate—they learn to paint intuitively,
though later the most assiduous study is given to acquire the characteristic
touch of the school with which they affiliate. The brush is
their <i>génie</i>, subservient to their imagination; they master and “juggle”
with it. For no foreign taught technique will they barter their
birthright.</p>

<p>And our masters and instructors in art more and more recognize
the value of initial brush-work. The following excerpt from Walter
Crane, in <i>Line and Form</i>, might serve as a preface to a work on
Hokusai or Hiroshige: “The practice of forming letters with the
brush afforded a very good preliminary practice to a student of line
and form. An important attribute of line is its power of expressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
or suggesting movement. Undulating lines always suggest
action and unrest or the resistance of force of some
kind. The firm-set yet soft feathers of a bird must be
rendered by a different touch from the shining scales of
a fish. The hair and horns of animals, delicate human features,
flowers, the sinuous lines of drapery, or the massive folds of heavy
robes, all demand from the draughtsman in line different kinds of
suggestive expression.”</p>

<p>We are told that Hiroshige began his career by making pictures
in coloured sands on an adhesive background, to amuse the public,
and perhaps this artistic juggling helped him later in arranging his
schemes of colour, for the limitations of the block demanded almost
equal simplicity in composition.</p>

<p>The impressions of Lake Biwa, one of Hiroshige’s finest series
of views, serve as a beautiful illustration of the almost exclusive use
of line in bringing out the salient characteristics of the landscape.
His sweeping brush shows us volcanic mountains, encircling the lake,
like rocky billows, torn and jagged, for legend says that as the peerless
mountain Fuji-san rose in one night, so the ground sank, and the
space was filled by the beautiful lake named from its resemblance
in form to the Japanese lute. The trees which fringe the shore, black
and misty, upon close inspection resolve themselves into a network of
criss-cross lines and blotches. The sampans’ sails, the waves, the
rushes on the shore, the roofs of the village nestling beneath the cliffs,
are all adroitly rendered by horizontal lines and skillful zigzags. The
rest of the composition is a wash of shaded blues and grays, fading
towards the horizon into smoky violets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>Biwa, the beautiful, suggestive of mystery, the four-stringed
lute gives thee her name. Through the music
of thy rippling eddies do sighs well up in thee, the murmur
of the lost? A pall of darkness hovers over thee,
pierced by a gleam of sunshine, beckoning like a lover’s hand.</p>

<p>Much diversity of opinion exists with regard to the identity of the
artist, or artists, who designed the prints signed Hiroshige. The latest
research, however, justifies the assertion that there was but one landscape
painter, Hiroshige the Great.</p>

<p>The pupils,—notably one, who, among other names, signed Shigenobu,
until after his master’s death, when he took the title of Hiroshige
the Second, gradually assuming his full <i>nom-de-pinceau</i>, Hiroshige
Ichiryusai,—faithfully imitated his style, also amplifying the
multitudinous designs and sketches made by the master, yet the genius
of the great artist is stamped upon his work, and as a clever critic
tersely says: “Everything he touched was his autograph.”</p>

<p>Mr. John S. Happer, an indefatigable student of Ukiyo-ye and
collector of nishiki-ye gems, during diligent research, discovered a
clew that leads, beyond controversy, to the right attribution of the
prints signed Hiroshige, and which he intends later to make public.
Nearly all the important vertical sets, he says, most of which have
been ascribed to the second Hiroshige, are by the first artist, although
doubtless his pupils assisted him in his work, rendering their aid, as
did the pupils of Hokusai in the preparation of the Mang-wa. Hiroshige
also associated himself at times with other artists, one set of
the Kisokaido, for example, being in part the work of Keisai Yeisen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
and he supplied many backgrounds to the prints of Kunisada
and Kuniyoshi.</p>

<p>In the catalogue of the “Collection Hayashi” only
two prints are assigned to pupils of Hiroshige, one of
them bearing the signature of Shigenobu.</p>

<p>The masterpieces signed Hiroshige are all by one great genius,
the Apostle of Impressionism. “Hiro, Hiro, Hiroshige, great is Hiroshige,”
cries Mr. Happer, in an outburst of enthusiasm. "Before
Hiroshige there was no Japanese landscape master,—after him there
is none."</p>

<p>In the “Happer” Collection is a memorial portrait of Hiroshige
by Kunisada (Toyokuni), the inscription upon which is of especial
interest, confirming, as it does, the date of his death and proving that
the “Meisho Yedo Hiak’kei,” the vertical set of Yedo views, so
often ascribed to his successor, were by the master.</p>

<p>The inscription is thus quaintly interpreted by a Japanese student:</p>

<p>"Ryusai Hiroshige is a distinguished follower of Toyohiro, who
was a follower of Toyoharu, the founder of the Utagawa School.
At the present time, Hiroshige, Toyokuni and Kuniyoshi are considered
the three great masters of Ukiyo-ye,—no others equal them.
Hiroshige was especially noted for landscape. In the Ansei era,
1854-1859, he published the ‘Meisho Yedo Hiak’kei’ (‘Hundred
Views of Yedo’), which vividly present the scenery of Yedo to the
multitude of admirers.</p>

<p>"About this time also appeared a magazine entitled ‘Meisho
Zuye’ (‘Sonnets on Yedo Scenes’), a monthly, illustrated by Hiroshige,
and displaying his wonderful skill with the brush, to the admiration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
of the world. He passed away, to the world beyond,
on the sixth day of the ninth month of this year,
1858, at the ripe age of sixty-two (sixty-one by our
count). He left behind a last testament, or farewell
sonnet, ‘<i>Azuma ji ni fude wo no-koshite tabi no sora; Nishi no mi
kuni no Meisho wo Mimu.</i>’ (Dropping the brush at Azuma, Eastern
Capital, I go the long journey to the Western Country, Buddhist
Heaven is in the West, to view the wonderful sceneries there; perchance
to limn them too.)</p>

<p>"This by Temmei Rojin, picture by Toyokuni.</p>

<p>“Dated, Ansei 5, ninth month (October, 1858).”</p>

<p>The best known prints by Hiroshige are the “Fifty-three Stations
between Yedo and Kyoto.” This Tokaido series was at first beautifully
printed, but the later impressions show a sad decay in the
colouring. The “Yedo Haik’kei” or “Hundred Views of Yedo,”
give a panoramic vista of the Shoguns’ capital. The pictorial description
of Yedo, in black and pale blue, is a lovely series. In many
of these landscapes the Dutch influence is very marked, for the master
of Hiroshige, Toyohiro, from whom he derived the first syllable of
his <i>nom-de-pinceau</i>, had experimented in landscape painting after the
Dutch wood-cuts which were scattered throughout the country. Although
Hiroshige is best known through his landscapes, he, like most
Japanese painters, was too universal an artist to confine himself solely
to one branch. He loved every phase of nature, and in one of his
well-known prints, “The Eagle,” his skill in the delineation of birds
is best shown. In the later impressions a pale yellowish tone takes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
place of the beautiful steel-blue background of the earlier
prints, miracles of colour printing.</p>

<p>Athwart this background of ineffable blue, which
loses itself in the mists that veil the sacred mountain, is
seen, sweeping and sailing cruelly alert, the evil eagle of Hiroshige.
His wicked gaze is set on nests of murmuring wood-doves, he eyes
the callow sea-birds in their bed of rushes. The temple bell rings
solemnly; the long vibrations cleave the azure dusk. It is the hour
of rest and dreams. Begone, base harbinger of evil!</p>

<p>In the early prints by Hiroshige the colours are most beautiful,
one soft tone fading imperceptibly into another, the blues and greens
so marvellously blended as to be almost interchangeable. We are
told that Michelangelo loved the companionship of the old workman
who ground his colours; and of the Japanese, it is said, “this making
one family of the greater artist and all who had to do with him
has given that peculiar completeness, that sense of peace and absence
of struggle which we feel in Japanese art.”</p>

<p>In vain Hiroshige fought, towards the middle of the nineteenth
century, against introduction of cheap and inferior pigments, which
were taking the place of the native dyes—Nature’s gifts, distilled
by her artist children. Reds, yellows, blues and greens, intense and
crude, were now imported, and Western commercialism sapped the
virtue of the sincere and devoted artists and artisans of the Orient.</p>

<p>In describing the effect of colour in one of the Nikko temples, W.
B. Van Ingen throws a searchlight upon the chemical secrets of this
splendour, which he tells us, if asked to describe in one word, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
word would be “golden.” "These colours," he says,
“are not imitations of colours. If vermilion is used,
it is cinnabar and not commercialized vermilion which
is employed, nor is something substituted for cobalt because
it is cheaper and will ‘do just as well.’ Each colour is used
because it is beautiful and frank as a colour, not because some other
colour is beautiful. If lacquer is the best medium to display the
beauty of the pigment, lacquer is used, and if water is better, lacquer
is discarded, and if these colours are not imitations of colours, neither
are they suggestions of colours. Pink is not used for red; if it is used
at all, it is used for its own beauty, and feeble bluish washes are not
made to do service for blue. The Oriental has not yet learned the
doctrine of substitution; he knows that substitution is transformation.”</p>

<p>The secrets of colouring of the early prints, the joy of Parisian
studios and which inspired Whistler, are lost. The delicious greens
of old mosses, the pale rose tints, the veinings and marblings, the
iridescent tints of ocean shells, the luminous colours of the anemone,
the <i>bleus malades des mauves</i>—that divine violet, a benison of the
palette handed down by those old Buddhist monks, the earliest painters
of India and China.</p>

<p>These visions of colour are taking the place of obscurity and
gloom, for the great impressionists, Claude Monet, Manet, the Barbizon
school also and its disciples, have abjured the old dark shadows
and substituted violet washes, seeming to share the privilege with the
saints and sages of “seeing blue everywhere.” All true artists live
“within the sphere of the infinite images of the soul.” These seers
are their own masters, and, as Theodore Child says so exquisitely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
“they are of rare and special temperaments, and through
their temperament they look at nature and see beautiful
personal visions. They fix their visions in colour or
marble and then disappear forever, carrying with them
the secrets of their mysterious intellectual processes.” Such a special
temperament was bequeathed to Whistler. He submitted himself to
the Japanese influence, not imitating but imbibing oriental methods,
and following them, notwithstanding Philistine clamour, for the
English art doctrines of the time were diametrically opposed to these
innovations. Regardless of sneers, he followed the bent of his genius,
which led him into oriental fields. He felt the sweet influence of such
artists as Hokusai and Hiroshige. He took advantage of the centuries
of thought given to drapery, in the land where, as with Greece, dress
is a national problem; where no fads and follies of fashion fostered by
commercialism are allowed; where the artists design dress, and the
people gratefully and sincerely adopt their ideas.</p>

<p>When we can follow them and allow art to rule, then hideous
vagaries and vulgarities, distortions of the figure by hoops and wires,
and monstrosities in sleeves will cease. Then may we hope to be an
æsthetic nation. We need our American Moronobus to design and
embroider and paint dresses for their beautiful and intuitively tasteful
countrywomen.</p>

<p>The colour vision of the Oriental far surpasses our own. His
eyes are sensitive to colour harmonies which, applied to landscape,
at first seem unreal, impossible, until we realize that though they present
objects in hues intrinsically foreign to them, yet the result justifies
this arrangement, and its integrity is recognized, for the impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
we receive is the true one. And this chaotic massing of
colour we notice in a landscape by Hiroshige was employed
by many of the old masters. Of the stormy
passion of Tintoret, Ruskin says: “He involves his earth
in coils of volcanic cloud, and withdraws through circle flaming above
circle the distant light of paradise.”</p>

<p>There is a keynote to art, as to music, and to genius; through
the inner vision this harmony is revealed. It lies within the precincts
of the soul, beyond the reach of talented mediocrity, however versed
in the canon of art. Nor can this occult gift be handed down. The
most ardent disciples of Raphael tried in vain to express themselves
after his pattern. The sublime inspiration which found its fullest outward
manifestation in the Sistine Madonna rested there. The poets
realized this colour vision, for Dante cried—</p>

<p>
“Had I a tongue in eloquence as rich<br >
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As is the colouring in Fancy’s loom.”</span><br >
</p>

<p>Inspiration must be sought by other than mechanical means. Have not
the most inspired revelations of colour come to the great master,
William Keith, when, invoking the aid of his old temple bell, its lingering
vibrations yielded to him rich secrets of colour harmony, as
the song of the bell revealed to the soul of Schiller the mystery of
life and birth and death, which he crystallized in his immortal poem?</p>

<p>This is the keynote of Impressionism, the touchstone of art. What
a fairy wand was wafted by Whistler, standing upon Battersea
Bridge! “The evening mist,” he said, “clothes the riverside with
poetry, as with a veil, and the poor buildings lose themselves in the
dim sky, and the tall chimneys become Campanili, and the warehouses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
are palaces in the night and the whole city hangs
in the heavens, and fairyland is before us!”</p>

<p>Leaning upon the bridge, the sweet influence of Hiroshige
permeating his soul, in the crucible of his fancy he
blent with the radiant Orient a vision of old London, grimy and
age-worn, and realized “a Japanese fancy on the banks of the gray
Thames.” To this picture he set the seal of his brother artist, and
so the two apostles of Impressionism, Occidental and Oriental, in that
loveliest nocturne, will together go down to posterity.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Analytical_Comparisons">Analytical Comparisons<br >

<small>between the Masters of Ukiyo-ye.</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap"
  src="images/i.png" alt="I" /></div>
<p class="pfirst">T is difficult rightly to determine the distinguishing characteristics
of the noted artists of Ukiyo-ye: but the connoisseurs
speak of the extreme grace of pictorial line in Moronobu:
the sweeping areas of pattern in the garments of Kiyonobu
and his followers, and their forceful ways of outlining
the folds of drapery, all full of meaning.</p>

<p>Grace and delicacy mark the idyllic compositions of Harunobu
and his successor Koriusai (the face of the Japanese woman is the
face of Harunobu, Koriusai, Shunsho and his school). M. de Goncourt
says: "The Japanese woman is lithe, little, and rounded. Out
of this woman Utamaro created the slender, svelte woman of his
prints,—a woman who has the delicate outlines of an early Watteau
sketch. Before Utamaro, Kiyonaga had drawn women, larger than
nature, but fleshy and thick. The face of the ordinary Japanese
woman is short and squat, and except for the inexpressible vivacity
and sweetness of the black eyes it is the face which Harunobu, Koriusai
and Shunsho represented. Out of this face Utamaro created a
long oval. He slid into the traditional treatment of the features a
mutinous grace, a naïve astonishment, a spiritual comprehension; and
he was the first artist who attempted, while preserving the consecrated
traditional lines, to blend with them a human expression, so that
his best prints become real portraits. Studying them, we no longer
see only the universal, but the individual face, and, unlike the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Japanese artists, he idealizes his countrywoman through
the mimicry of her gracious humanity."</p>

<p>The women of Kiyonaga have a more than human
dignity and grace, the classic folds of his drapery recalling
figures of the Renaissance. The Japanese artist always has
an underlying motive in the disposition of his drapery. The most
recognizable perhaps are those called “Guantai,” signifying rude,
with angular outlines, and “Rintai,” delicate, supple and wavy, like
the undulations of a river.</p>

<p>In the “Guantai” motive we see the angles of the rocks, even in
the most delicate folds of drapery. In “Rintai” no angle is visible.
Here wavelike ripples descend, flowing around the feet of the wearer.
In these swirls of drapery are realized the Buddhist conceptions of Life
in everything,—the lines are moving, sentient, and all but the leading
folds that determine the lines of the figure are suppressed. The Japanese
painter knows that the true master selects, does not draw all
he sees, but concentrates his efforts towards reproducing the lines of
movement, and in figures, the lines of the limbs and flowing drapery.
In their designs for dresses the artists of Ukiyo-ye emphasized the
theorem that art is the love of certain balanced relations and proportions,
for they planned dresses in which every separate part is welded
into one harmonious whole. They solved theories in colour, and delighted
in selecting as trials for their skill the most unmanageable
patterns, such as plaids and checks. They extolled “Notan” or the
decorative use of values.</p>

  <div class="caption">Two Ladies.

a mystic, even religious
expression,
like the women of the
Middle Ages.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>In the best prints the decoration of the dress fits in with the
scheme of the picture. M. de Goncourt says: “If the figures are
represented out of doors, flowers seem to be shed upon
the dresses, as if the wearer passed beneath blossoming
trees. If the artist paints butterflies on a costume, they
harmonize with the background. If peonies are used
he alternates their whiteness with a purple tint. And how admirable
is their use of relief! Upon a blue or mauve gown, how charming
is the white relief of an embossed cherry petal, and so marvellously
executed is this goffering, that many of the oldest impressions retain
the impression as perfectly as if only printed yesterday.” Utamaro
at first equalled Kiyonaga in the majesty of his figures, later he lost
beauty and strength in exaggeration. Yeishi shows a striking
resemblance to Utamaro, and he, too, followed after Kiyonaga: his
studies of women are noted for their refined elegance. Yeisen compares
with Utamaro in the grace with which he portrays women,
and Yeizan’s lines are stronger, but show a marked similarity. Hartmann
says: "The linear beauties of the representations of Yeizan,
Yeishi, Yeisen, impress one like a Nautch, like some languid oriental
dance in which the bodies undulate with an almost imperceptible
vibration. The Japanese see in a woman, a glorification of all
beautiful things—they even study the natural grace of the willow,
plum and cherry trees, to find the correct expression of her
movements."</p>

<p>Toyokuni was the master of mimetic art. In his actor faces he
runs the gamut of emotion,—jealousy, passion, fiendish fury and
concentrated cunning, rush at us from his prints. Toyokuni, the
Marionette maker, forced life into the forms of his puppets, and later
the same power is shown in his designs for the block. Like many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
of the Ukiyo-ye artists, he employs caricature, but his
figures are living, sentient.</p>

<p>M. de Goncourt says: “In comparing two books by
Utamaro, and Toyokuni, illustrating the occupations of
the women of the Yoshiwara Toyokuni, often the equal of Utamaro
in his triptychs is beaten by his rival. His women have not the
elegance, the willowy grace, the figures of Utamaro possess, nor
their resplendent personality. His pictures lack the spirit, the life,
the ‘trick’ of voluptuousness of the women of the ‘Flower Quarter.’
Then the comic note which Toyokuni sought for in representing
these scenes, adds triviality to his work. In short, to judge between
the rival painters, one has only to place side by side a woman painted
by Utamaro and one by Toyokuni. The first is a little marvel, the
second only a commonplace print.” Kunisada followed in the
footsteps of his master Toyokuni, adding charming backgrounds,
which he borrowed from Hiroshige; in fact, the Hiroshige are said
to have supplied many backgrounds to the prints of Kunisada and
Kuniyoshi.</p>

<p>Hokusai used all methods, acknowledged no school. His lines
flowing out of the prescribed limits hint at vast stretches of country.
Swirls of waves foam up in the impressions, supplying an alphabet of
motion. In Mang-wa is blent sweetness and power, structure and
the fundamental vital motive, underlying all art. When working
for the engraver he was concise, rapid and impulsive, but when contemplating
nature he sketched in freedom,—his execution became
fairylike.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>The landscape of Hiroshige, though confined to the narrow
range of the wood-cut, have all the qualities of Impressionism,
the details are subordinated, only the salient
points of the scene being represented, but the atmosphere
supplies what is lacking, and this incommunicable, subtle
gift, the birthright of the artists, enabled them to conjure living
pictures from the hard medium of the wooden block.</p>

<p>The following suggestive comparisons between the masters of
Ukiyo-ye, kindly volunteered by Mr. Morgan Shepard, are full of
value to the student, as the individual opinion of a refined amateur
and art critic.</p>

<p>Of Harunobu he says: "Though from the point of proportion
his figures seem to lack technic, the naïve artlessness of his lines
perfectly satisfies us. In this purpose of simplicity they almost
suggest the qualities of the fresco work by the early Tuscan masters,
when the spirit was striving for expression and working out individuality
along its own spiritual lines. The vigour of his stroke
impresses one as being untraditional.</p>

<p>"In the figure of the Dancer by Shunko, the pupil of Shunsho,
we observe that, although through training and tradition the pupil
has gained a greater facility, yet the simplicity of the master is lost
in an excess of elaboration. The lines resemble those of Shunsho,
though there is more uniformity of stroke, with a greater delicacy,
but the simplicity of the first artist is merged in decorative purpose.
Shunsho is distinctly simple and his lines have a blended quality
of relation, giving a sense of repose which in the pupil is obscured
by the tendency to elaborate.</p>

<p>"In epitomizing the cardinal qualities expressed in the Utamaro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
prints, the most marked is the suggestion of subjective,
unconscious skill that gives no impress of the objective.
Each line seems to come directly from the fountain-head
of the man’s spiritual or soul nature, though this
very soul nature expresses itself often along sensual lines. Indeed,
were the artist less of a spiritual genius, he would often become
revoltingly sensual. To the casual observer the lines of Utamaro
show wonderful facility, and still greater delicacy, yet we cannot
but observe underlying all his art, especially in its later phases,
this subtle sensuality. The lower draperies of the Utamaro figures
have an almost insinuating fullness.</p>

<p>"The compositions of Yeishi, upon superficial study, suggest
marked facility and even some originality in line composition, with
here and there an eccentricity which gives character to his treatment.
The lines seem to be invariably broad and openly expressed. They
lack the strong personality and vigorous treatment of Hokusai, the
suggestive delicacy and voluptuousness of Utamaro, but seem to
embody the vigorous calligraphic stroke of Kiyonaga. We can place
Yeishi upon a plane of individuality because of his sensitive temperament
which seemed to be influenced by his environment and his
master teacher. This varied individuality was accompanied by a
tendency towards imitation, yet a generous discrimination would
concede to him facility, technic, refinement and rare judgment.</p>

<p>"The lines of Toyokuni show technical skill, and his calligraphic
stroke is simple and vigorous, yet he lacks the spiritual and
suggestive delicacy of Utamaro, giving the impression that externalities
influenced him, rather than the finer shades of artistic interpretation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>His best work is histrionic and is full of individuality,
breaking through the traditional stage attitudes, which
impressed the artists who developed along his lines.</p>

<p>"Yeizan’s treatment is peculiarly his own, having a
simplicity almost amounting to awkwardness expressed in a reserve of
treatment. The casual observer is impressed by a sense of incompleteness,
but this is overcome when the simple harmony of the lines
is noted. Yeizan invariably breaks loose from his first reserve. Beginning
very carefully he gradually loses his constraint, and the lower
part of his drapery shows greater impulse of treatment.</p>

<p>“The work of Yeisen, showing much of Utamaro’s facility, with
a touch of the vigour of Kiyonaga, is yet distinctly conceived along
traditional lines. It bears the strong impress of decorative sense, but
nevertheless the lines, though simple and well controlled, show rather
the finished master of technic than the originative mind. In Yeisen
we are less conscious of that emanating quality of originality and
forceful personality that we feel in Harunobu, Hokusai and
Utamaro.”</p>

<p>In analyzing the composition of the celebrated work by Hokusai,
reproduced on the opposite page, Mr. Shepard comments: “In
this, as in all Hokusai’s pictures, we note the combination of vigour
and gentleness, characteristic aggression and insinuating suggestion,
an absolutely masterly touch, and yet painstaking in minutiæ. The
poise of the figure is admirable and absolutely satisfying in all
matters of drawing. The treatment of the waves, which are peculiarly
characteristic of the master’s touch, in their foamy sputter suggest
a comparison with the strength of Hiroshige’s huge billows, majestic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
in their oily smoothness and sweeping grace. Giving the
impression of the middle distance, the artist has delicately
approached with the most wonderful ease, the vapory
suggestion of the distant mountain line. He slips
from the vigour of the foreground with a parallel stroke of
astonishing freedom, seeming almost to remain poised, so that we
reach without violence the faintly suggested distance as if we had
unconsciously slid from reality into dreamland, unknowing of the
transition. Hokusai possesses a masterly technic, a characteristic
vigour, imagination, delicacy ofttimes opposed by a brutal ruggedness,
and above all a pervading sense of humour.”</p>

of Ukiyo-ye Gems.</h2>
</div>


<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap"
  src="images/t.png" alt="T" /></div>
<p class="pfirst">O truly appreciate Japanese prints, a knowledge of
the language of the block must first be acquired, then
the pursuit has an indescribable charm, inexplicable excepting
to the initiated, but to those who have fallen
under the spell, the love of Ukiyo-ye gems becomes a veritable
passion. The collector of old prints must be guided in his selection
by the quality of the paper, which should be soft and vibrant, the
fibrous tentacles upon its surface often forming shadows where it has
been exposed to the dust. The register must be perfect, each colour
being confined absolutely to its prescribed space. Perfection in the
register is an infallible guide, and prints with a perfect register will
increase in value. The colours must be soft and melting, in many
cases one tone shading into another, not harshly determined by the
lines of the block, as in even the most beautiful reproductions. The
florid colouring of the later impressions by the Hiroshige are notable
examples of the deterioration caused by the use of cheap pigments
and the haste of the printer who had to supply the increasing demand
for cheap pictures.</p>

<p>There are often exquisite examples of colouring to be found
among the later impressions from the old blocks, but the lovely colours
and nuances of colours conjured by the artists, designers and printers
in loving collaboration, before commercialism had invaded Japan,
can never be seen again, even as the disciples of William Morris
seem unable to reproduce the beautiful shades which the genius
of the master workman evolved from the dyeing-vat.</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
